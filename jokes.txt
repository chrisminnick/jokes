                           101 WAYS TO ANNOY PEOPLE

   As an expert on the art of annoying and irritating others, I have
   endeavored to compile a list of methods I have developed, used,or read
   about, with which to annoy people. Some are very simple, some take
   preparation, some are very old, some are new. At least 1/4 of them are
   guaranteed to annoy your victim. Have fun!


    1. Put your face really close to theirs while they're facing a
       different direction, tap them on the shoulder, and watch them jump
       when they turn to face you.

    2. Copy their actions and everything they say.

    3. Step on the backs of their heels while they're walking.

    4. Yell across a crowded room to them: "Hey, John, the results came
       back from the V.D. clinic: we're clean!"

    5. In a communal shower or shower house, turn the hot water all the
       way up and the cold water all the way down (or vice versa) while
       they're rinsing the shampoo out of their hair and can't see
       anything. Or, when you're finished showering, go outside and turn
       the main valve off.

    6. Pretend you don't understand what they're saying, no matter how
       much they yell and how slowly they say it.

    7. When somebody asks, "Hey, did you get a haircut?" reply, "No, all
       of them."

    8. When somebody asks, "Do you have the time?" reply, "Yeah."

    9. If you have a dot matrix printer, leave the little computer paper
       tracks on the paper when turning in a report or essay.

   10. Ask an artist, "It's not finished yet, is it?"

   11. On a summer day, ask anybody, "Hot enuff for ya?"(NOTE: Proper
       response to this question is to hit offender in the face and ask,
       "Hurt enough for you?")

   12. Sign someone up on a junk mail list.

   13. Go into a frozen yogurt joint where they have lots of toppings.
       Order a cup, and say to the guy, in the most annoying tone
       imaginable, "Do you have M&M's? Yeah? Good. How 'bout raisins?
       Yeah, and sprinkles. Do you have cookie crumbs?" After he has
       proceeded to put them on the yogurt, exclaim, "I hate cookie
       crumbs. They make me sick. I can't even smell them, that's how
       much I hate them. Aagh, yuck!" Watch the salesperson fume as he is
       forced to throw away the entire cup.

   14. Walk into a store that has a sign that says, "Have a penny? Give a
       penny! Need a penny? Take a penny!" with a HUGE jar of pennies.
       Take a penny out of the cup, put it into your jar, and walk out.

   15. Pull up alongside somebody while driving on the freeway, and
       gesture violently, indicating that they should pull over
       immediately. When they pull over, just continue driving.

   16. Take a pencil, stick a piece of chewed gum onto it, and stick it
       to the ground. Then wait for some cheap-o to come along and try to
       pick it up.

   17. Play 'Penis.'

   18. While standing next to someone, unobtrusively reach your arm
       around their back, and tap them on the opposite shoulder.

   19. Tell someone, "Okay, here's what you do: bite down on both your
       pinky nails really hard for about thirty seconds, and then when I
       tell you that time is up, link your pinkies and pull really hard."
       If they ask, "Why?" tell them that it feels really neat. If done
       correctly, this trick should cause excruciating pain.

   20. Engage someone in a conversation, and have a friend sneak up
       behind them, and get down on his hands and knees. Then, all of a
       sudden, violently push the person to whom you are talking, and
       laugh with sadistic glee as they tumble backwards over the person
       kneeling behind them.

   21. Tell someone, "Man, your hands smell bad!" When they try to smell
       their hand, smack it so it hits their face. This one can also be
       performed with a piece of pie. When they lean down to smell the
       pie, grab the back of their head and smoosh it into the pie.

   22. After somebody finishes telling a joke, say in a very grave tone,
       "My brother (sister/mother/father) died that way."

   23. Walk up behind somebody wearing a button down shirt or a short
       sleeved collar shirt, insert your finger into the little strip of
       fabric sewn across the top just below the collar, yell "FAG TAG!"
       at the top of your lungs, and rip it off.

   24. Give somebody a grundy.

   25. Pinch a guy's nipple. You may also pinch a girl's nipple if you
       please, but this falls under '101 Ways to Sexually Harass People.'

   26. Leave the following message on someone's answering machine: "Sir,
       we're not sure if you wanted us to do it, you know, after what
       happened, so, well, we went ahead and did it anyway. If you don't
       like it, we can probably take it out, but we'll have to charge you
       extra. Please return this call immediately. Thanks."

   27. Tell somebody that's wearing velcro shoes or slip-ons that their
       shoelaces are untied.

   28. Tell lots of puns.

   29. Be a Jew for Jesus.

   30. Give somebody a Wet Willy.

   31. Turn on somebody's radio up all the way and turn their windshield
       wipers on while the car is off.

   32. Take a stick of gum out of it's paper and foil wrapper, then
       carefully re-fold the foil wrapper and stick it back into the
       paper wrapper. Offer this to someone as a stick of gum.

   33. Pay for a tube of toothpaste with a check at the supermarket.

   34. On the bus, try to engage somebody in a conversation about genital
       warts.

   35. Delete somebody's AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files.

   36. When walking behind someone outside, pull up a long piece of
       grass, and gently tickle them behind the ear with it. The first
       time, they'll try to brush it away. The second time they'll swat
       at it, and smack themselves. Generally, the third time they turn
       around and look behind themselves.

   37. Take a wire, and stick it all the way through a cigar or
       cigarette. Let the ash get really long, and pretend you don't
       notice everybody staring at it, waiting for it to fall.

   38. When they're about half way through with it, remove one piece from
       the box of a jigsaw puzzle, and throw it away.

   39. Hide the remote control.

   40. Call a house at random, and ask for Gary. When they tell you that
       there's no Gary there, call again a little while later. Do this at
       intervals about four times. Finally, when they're fuming and about
       to scream bloody murder, call a fifth time, and say, "Hi, this is
       Gary. Are there any messages for me?"

   41. Take a deck of cards, and say, "Okay, I'm gonna do a magic trick."
       Ask the person to pick any card, and put it anywhere in the deck.
       After they have shuffled the deck thoroughly, take the deck back.
       Ask, "What was your card?" When they tell you, say, "Not only has
       your card magically come to the top of the deck, but it has also
       magically turned into..." Pick up the top card, look at it, and
       name it.

   42. When somebody is talking very excitedly at a restaurant, pick up
       their plate, hand it to them, and nod gravely. Wait for them to
       notice and wonder why they are holding their plate.

   43. Exclaim in a crowded theater, "No, I won't touch you there for a
       dollar! No, not two dollars, either!"

   44. Approach somebody quietly from behind, grab them, and scream,
       "Booga booga!" or any other such exclamation loudly. This works
       extremely well on high strung people.

   45. Be chronically late. Not really late, but always be about five or
       seven minutes late. This really gets anal retentive people. I
       know.

   46. Shave with someone elses razor. For some reason, a lot of people
       are really touchy about that. Once again, I know.


   47. Once again at a restaurant, one with a candle in the middle of the
       table, while someone is up before the food has come, take their
       plate, hold the bottom rim over the candle, and rotate it so you
       get a lot of soot on the bottom of the plate. When they come back,
       say, "I'm going to hypnotize you. Pick up your plate in your left
       hand, and with your right hand, copy all my actions." Proceed to
       rub your index finger around the bottom rim of your plate, and in
       a circle on your forehead. Then around the rim, and each of your
       eyes. Keep going, with different parts of the face, until they
       notice.

   48. Cut out an article or section of the newspaper before someone else
       has had a chance to read it.

   49. Send a letter with twenty-nine one cent stamps.

   50. Go into a locker room with a pocket knife, and cut off all the
       shoelaces that are hanging out of the lockers.

   51. When someone asks, "Are there any questions?" ask, "Where do
       babies come from?" This is one of my favorites.

   52. Step on someone's feet, and push them backwards.

   53. Take their hat.

   54. Grab a book that someone is reading, open it to the last page, and
       read this out loud.

   55. When riding shotgun in a convertible, surreptitiously reach over
       and put up just the rear windows. In a convertible, this looks
       REALLY stupid.

   56. Take an envelope, fill it with baking powder or flour,and send it
       to somebody.

   57. At a fast food restaurant, push down the bubbles on the drink tops
       of everybody's drink.

   58. Crack all your knuckles. A lot of people can't stand fingers, and
       I know some people who have almost fainted upon the cracking of
       the neck.

   59. Sing, "I know a song that gets on everybody's nerves, I know a
       song that gets on everybody's nerves..." over and over again to
       the tune of the first two lines of The Battle Hymn of the
       Republic.

   60. Pay for an item at a store with all pennies.

   61. When you're out of the house all night for a weekend, leave your
       clock-radio on for it's normal wake-up time of about 6:30 or 7:30,
       and turn the volume up.

   62. At a red light, put your car in gear and creep slowly forward,
       while gesturing to the person in the car next to you that they
       must be rolling backwards.

   63. Drive with your brights on just to see how many people flash their
       lights at you.

   64. Tailgating can be one of the most effective forms of annoyance
       know to man.

   65. Walk up to someone you know, and say something to the effect of,
       "Hey, did you hear what happened to Jim? Well he was with...oh,
       man, I really shouldn't tell you this. No, I promised I wouldn't
       tell. No, I can't tell you, sorry."


   66. When they are out of their room, move everything they own to a
       different location.

   67. Change all the preset stations on their car radio tuner to
       classical and country/western stations.

   68. Slurp your soup or your breakfast cereal.

   69. Tap the person on the shoulder continuously, and when you have
       their attention, just continue tapping them on the shoulder.

   70. At a movie theater, unwrap a candy bar as loudly as is humanly
       possible, preferably during dialogue.

   71. At a public library, get a book which hasn't been checked out yet,
       and slip it into somebody's book bag when they're not looking.

   72. Take off the letters one of those sign boards that have the
       removable letters. Spell rude things with them.

   73. Answer the phone "Domino's Pizza, how can I help you?" at someone
       else's house. Or at your own house, if you really want.

   74. At night, rearrange somebody's furniture. At the very least,
       they'll be surprised when they get up in the morning. But, better
       yet, call them in the middle of the night, so they have to get up,
       and stumble over a chair that wasn't there before.

   75. Many telephone answering machines have two digit passwords for
       retrieving messages and that kind of thing, and often times, the
       default on many models is 25, which people don't bother to change.
       This is an excellent way to hack answering machines, or, if this
       doesn't work, it's not that hard to try all 100 combinations.
       Regardless, once you've hacked the machine, a fun thing to do is
       to change the message. This is supremely annoying.

   76. Call a credit card company and report somebody's card as missing.
       Next time they try to use it, they'll have it confiscated and cut
       into little bitty pieces.

   77. Take all the labels off of their video tapes.

   78. There are a myriad of non-harmful but incredibly annoying computer
       viruses, such as Red-X, Cascade, Heeva Havah, Whale, and more.
       Their effects vary, and they can be a pain in the butt to remove
       from one's hard drive.

   79. An old but still great and incredibly useful annoyance technique
       is the age old, tried and true 'Kick Me' sign on the back. A
       classic.

   80. Write taunting messages at random places in an assignment notebook
       or executive planner.

   81. Another classic is to get about three other people in on a joke
       that has no meaning at all, and tell it with those three people
       and the victim in the room. All the people 'in' on the joke laugh,
       and the victim doesn't get it. When he asks, say, "Oh, never mind.
       If you don't get it, it's not worth explaining. My favorite is, "A
       hippo and a penguin are taking a bath together. The hippo says,
       'Pass the soap,' and the penguin says, 'No soap. Radio!'"

   82. Yet another age old family of annoying jokes are as follows:
       "Would you happen to have a henway on you?" "A henway? What's a
       henway?" "About three pounds."

   83. Talk to the characters in a television show, like yelling out
       loud, "Don't go in there! The bad guys are in there!"

   84. When you take a shower, leave the shower/bath valve on shower.

   85. Women hate it when men leave the toilet seat up.

   86. During an exam, tap your foot on the floor continuously. This
       works very well on linoleum, especially if you can find a part of
       the floor where the linoleum is coming loose, and it makes a very
       loud sound.

   87. Be a street mime.

   88. Remove the doorstop from hallway doors. Or better yet, if you have
       the time and the motivation, take out the screw that holds the two
       'arms' of the spring closer together.

   89. Write poetry for a school newspaper or publication.

   90. For women: ask your friends, "Do I look fat to you?"

   91. Put a lubricated condom on somebody's door knob.

   92. Go out behind somebody's house at night, and find the box marked
       "Illinois Bell Customer Service," or whatever state you live in.
       Open this up using a flat head screwdriver, and attach a wire
       across the green and red wires. This will leave the phone off
       hook, and once the too-long-off-hook signal starts going, the
       person will be forced to go to another's house to use the phone to
       call Ma Bell so they can figure out is going on.

   93. Put a dead fish in somebody's trunk. Works best during the summer.

   94. Take a chalkboard eraser and insert a piece of chalk into, so that
       when somebody goes to erase the board, they leave a chalk mark.

   95. At a restaurant, have the victim place both his hands on the table
       palms down. Balance a glass of water on the back of each hand. The
       person is now trapped, unable to remove either glass without help.
       (Actually, there is a solution: place your chin against one glass,
       and using that to hold it steady, remove the other glass.)

   96. A similar 'trap' is to have a person stick their forefinger and
       thumb through the space on the hinged side of an open door, just
       above the top hinge. Put an egg between their fingers and ask them
       to hold it. Then, take their hat and put it on the floor
       underneath the egg.
   97. Take a paper or styrofoam cup, and punch a small hole in it near
       the base. Grasp the cup, with your thumb over the hole, and fill
       it with water. Now, casually walk up to someone, and ask them to
       hold the cup.

   98. Take a bungee cord like the kind used to tie a car hood down, and
       while someone is sitting in a chair in front of you, carefully and
       quietly hook one end to their belt loop, and the other to the
       chair leg or underside. If they are sitting on a plastic chair,
       the chair will spring up when they stand up, and fall over, making
       a loud clatter. Better yet, though, if they're sitting near a wall
       fixture, just attach them to that.

   99. Shake up somebody's can of soda before they drink it.

   100. Loosen the tops on the salt and pepper shakers at a restaurant.

   101. Take a cheap ball point pen, and bend it sharply to break open
       the ink well, or open the pen up and cut the ink well open. Lend
       this pen to somebody.

		The Ten Commandments for C Programmers
			 (Annotated Edition)
			    Henry Spencer


I   Thou shalt run lint frequently and study its pronouncements with
    care, for verily its perception and judgement oft exceed thine.

    	This is still wise counsel, although many modern compilers
    	search out many of the same sins, and there are often problems
    	with lint being aged and infirm, or unavailable in strange
    	lands.  There are other tools, such as Saber C, useful to
    	similar ends.

    	``Frequently'' means thou shouldst draw thy daily guidance
    	from it, rather than hoping thy code will achieve lint's
    	blessing by a sudden act of repentance at the last minute.
    	De-linting a program which has never been linted before is
    	often a cleaning of the stables such as thou wouldst not wish
    	on thy worst enemies.  Some observe, also, that careful heed
    	to the words of lint can be quite helpful in debugging.

    	``Study'' doth not mean mindless zeal to eradicate every byte
    	of lint output--if for no other reason, because thou just
    	canst not shut it up about some things--but that thou should
    	know the cause of its unhappiness and understand what
    	worrisome sign it tries to speak of.

II  Thou shalt not follow the NULL pointer, for chaos and madness await
    thee at its end.

    	Clearly the holy scriptures were mis-transcribed here, as the
    	words should have been ``null pointer'', to minimize confusion
    	between the concept of null pointers and the macro NULL (of
    	which more anon).  Otherwise, the meaning is plain.  A null
    	pointer points to regions filled with dragons, demons, core
    	dumps, and numberless other foul creatures, all of which
    	delight in frolicing in thy program if thou disturb their
    	sleep.  A null pointer doth not point to a 0 of any type,
    	despite some blasphemous old code which impiously assumes
        this.

III  Thou shalt cast all function arguments to the expected type if
     they are not of that type already, even when thou art convinced
     that this is unnecessary, lest they take cruel vengeance upon
     thee when thou least expect it.

    	A programmer should understand the type structure of his
    	language, lest great misfortune befall him.  Contrary to the
    	heresies espoused by some of the dwellers on the Western
    	Shore, `int' and `long' are not the same type.  The moment of
    	their equivalence in size and representation is short, and the
    	agony that awaits believers in their interchangeability shall
    	last forever and ever once 64-bit machines become common.

    	Also, contrary to the beliefs common among the more backward
    	inhabitants of the Polluted Eastern Marshes, `NULL' does not
    	have a pointer type, and must be cast to the correct type
    	whenever it is used as a function argument.

    	(The words of the prophet Ansi, which permit NULL to be
    	defined as having the type `void *', are oft taken out of
    	context and misunderstood.  The prophet was granting a special
    	dispensation for use in cases of great hardship in wild lands.
    	Verily, a righteous program must make its own way through the
    	Thicket Of Types without lazily relying on this
    	rarely-available dispensation to solve all its problems.  In
    	any event, the great deity Dmr who created C hath wisely
    	endowed it with many types of pointers, not just one, and thus
    	it would still be necessary to convert the prophet's NULL to
    	the desired type.)

    	It may be thought that the radical new blessing of
    	``prototypes'' might eliminate the need for caution about
    	argument types.  Not so, brethren.  Firstly, when confronted
    	with the twisted strangeness of variable numbers of arguments,
    	the problem returns...  and he who has not kept his faith
    	strong by repeated practice shall surely fall to this subtle
    	trap.  Secondly, the wise men have observed that reliance on
    	prototypes doth open many doors to strange errors, and some
    	indeed had hoped that prototypes would be decreed for purposes
    	of error checking but would not cause implicit conversions.
    	Lastly, reliance on prototypes causeth great difficulty in the
    	Real World today, when many cling to the old ways and the old
    	compilers out of desire or necessity, and no man knoweth what
    	machine his code may be asked to run on tomorrow.

IV  If thy header files fail to declare the return types of thy library
    functions, thou shalt declare them thyself with the most
    meticulous care, lest grievous harm befall thy program.

    	The prophet Ansi, in her wisdom, hath added that thou shouldst
    	also scourge thy Suppliers, and demand on pain of
    	excommunication that they produce header files that declare
    	their library functions.  For truly, only they know the
    	precise form of the incantation appropriate to invoking their
    	magic in the optimal way.

    	The prophet hath also commented that it is unwise, and leads
    	one into the pits of damnation and subtle bugs, to attempt to
    	declare such functions thyself when thy header files do the
    	job right.

V   Thou shalt check the array bounds of all strings (indeed, all
    arrays), for surely where thou typest ``foo'' someone someday
    shall type ``supercalifragilisticexpialidocious''.

    	As demonstrated by the deeds of the Great Worm, a consequence
    	of this commandment is that robust production software should
    	never make use of gets(), for it is truly a tool of the Devil.
    	Thy interfaces should always inform thy servants of the bounds
    	of thy arrays, and servants who spurn such advice or quietly
    	fail to follow it should be dispatched forthwith to the Land
    	Of Rm, where they can do no further harm to thee.

VI  If a function be advertised to return an error code in the event
    of difficulties, thou shalt check for that code, yea, even though
    the checks triple the size of thy code and produce aches in thy
    typing fingers, for if thou thinkest ``it cannot happen to me'',
    the gods shall surely punish thee for thy arrogance.

    	All true believers doth wish for a better error-handling
    	mechanism, for explicit checks of return codes are tiresome in
    	the extreme and the temptation to omit them is great.  But
    	until the far-off day of deliverance cometh, one must walk the
    	long and winding road with patience and care, for thy Vendor,
    	thy Machine, and thy Software delight in surprises and think
    	nothing of producing subtly meaningless results on the day
    	before thy Thesis Oral or thy Big Pitch To The Client.

    	Occasionally, as with the ferror() feature of stdio, it is
    	possible to defer error checking until the end when a
    	cumulative result can be tested, and this often produceth code
    	which is shorter and clearer.  Also, even the most zealous
    	believer should exercise some judgement when dealing with
    	functions whose failure is totally uninteresting...  but
    	beware, for the cast to void is a two-edged sword that
    	sheddeth thine own blood without remorse.

VII  Thou shalt study thy libraries and strive not to reinvent them
     without cause, that thy code may be short and readable and thy
     days pleasant and productive.

    	Numberless are the unwashed heathen who scorn their libraries
    	on various silly and spurious grounds, such as blind worship
    	of the Little Tin God (also known as ``Efficiency'').  While
    	it is true that some features of the C libraries were
    	ill-advised, by and large it is better and cheaper to use the
    	works of others than to persist in re-inventing the square
    	wheel.  But thou should take the greatest of care to
    	understand what thy libraries promise, and what they do not,
    	lest thou rely on facilities that may vanish from under thy
    	feet in the future.

VIII  Thou shalt make thy program's purpose and structure clear to thy
      fellow man by using the One True Brace Style, even if thou
      likest it not, for thy creativity is better used in solving
      problems than in creating beautiful new impediments to
      understanding.

    	These words, alas, have caused some uncertainty among the
    	novices and the converts, who knoweth not the ancient wisdoms.
    	The One True Brace Style referred to is that demonstrated in
    	the writings of the First Prophets, Kernighan and Ritchie.
    	Often and again it is criticized by the ignorant as hard to
    	use, when in truth it is merely somewhat difficult to learn,
    	and thereafter is wonderfully clear and obvious, if perhaps a
    	bit sensitive to mistakes.

    	While thou might think that thine own ideas of brace style
    	lead to clearer programs, thy successors will not thank thee
    	for it, but rather shall revile thy works and curse thy name,
    	and word of this might get to thy next employer.  Many customs
    	in this life persist because they ease friction and promote
    	productivity as a result of universal agreement, and whether
    	they are precisely the optimal choices is much less important.
    	So it is with brace style.

    	As a lamentable side issue, there has been some unrest from
    	the fanatics of the Pronoun Gestapo over the use of the word
    	``man'' in this Commandment, for they believe that great
    	efforts and loud shouting devoted to the ritual purification
    	of the language will somehow redound to the benefit of the
    	downtrodden (whose real and grievous woes tendeth to get lost
    	amidst all that thunder and fury).  When preaching the gospel
    	to the narrow of mind and short of temper, the word
    	``creature'' may be substituted as a suitable pseudoBiblical
    	term free of the taint of Political Incorrectness.

IX  Thy external identifiers shall be unique in the first six
    characters, though this harsh discipline be irksome and the years
    of its necessity stretch before thee seemingly without end, lest
    thou tear thy hair out and go mad on that fateful day when thou
    desirest to make thy program run on an old system.

    	Though some hasty zealots cry ``not so; the Millenium is come,
    	and this saying is obsolete and no longer need be supported'',
    	verily there be many, many ancient systems in the world, and
    	it is the decree of the dreaded god Murphy that thy next
    	employment just might be on one.  While thou sleepest, he
    	plotteth against thee.  Awake and take care.

    	It is, note carefully, not necessary that thy identifiers be
    	limited to a length of six characters.  The only requirement
    	that the holy words place upon thee is uniqueness within the
    	first six.  This often is not so hard as the belittlers
    	claimeth.

X   Thou shalt foreswear, renounce, and abjure the vile heresy which
    claimeth that ``All the world's a VAX'', and have no commerce with
    the benighted heathens who cling to this barbarous belief, that
    the days of thy program may be long even though the days of thy
    current machine be short.

    	This particular heresy bids fair to be replaced by ``All the
    	world's a Sun'' or ``All the world's a 386'' (this latter
    	being a particularly revolting invention of Satan), but the
    	words apply to all such without limitation.  Beware, in
    	particular, of the subtle and terrible ``All the world's a
    	32-bit machine'', which is almost true today but shall cease
    	to be so before thy resume grows too much longer.

My Dearest Peter,
The cute little partridge arrived a little while ago, and the pear 
tree sapling came a little while later. I'm not sure of the
connection, but I love them.

Love always,
Dori

Dearest Peter,
Today the postman brought your very sweet gift. Just imagine, two 
turtle doves. I'm just delighted at your thoughtful gift. They are 
adorable.

All my love,=20
Dori

Dec. 16, 1995

Dearest Peter,

Aren't you the extravagent one. Now, I really must protest. I don't
deserve such generosity, three French hens. They are just darling, but
I must insist, you are too kind.

Love,
Dori

 - - - - - -

Dec 17, 1995

Dearest Peter,
Today the postman delivered four calling birds. Now really, they are
quite beautiful, but don't you think enough is enough? You are being
too romantic.

Affectionately,
Dori

- - - - - - -

Dec. 18, 1995

Dearest Peter,
What a surprise! Today the postman delivered five golden rings - one
for each finger. You are just impossible, but I love it. Frankly, all
those birds squawking were beginning to get on my nerves.

All my love,
Dori

- - - - - - -

Dec. 19, 1995

Dear Peter,
When I opened the door, there were actually six geese-a-laying on my
front step. So your back to the birds again, huh? These geese are
huge! Where will I keep them? The neighbors are complaining and I
can't get any sleep through all the racket. Please stop.

Cordially,
Dori

- - - - - - -

Dec 20, 1995

Pete,
What is it with you and those fucking birds? Seven swans-a-swimming. 
What kind of god-damned joke is this? There is bird shit all over my
house, and they never stop with the racket. I can't sleep at night and
I'm a nervous wreck. It's not funny, so stop with those fucking birds.

Sincerely,
Dori

Dec. 21, 1995

O.K. Buster,
I think I prefer the birds. What the hell am I going to do with 
eight maids-a-milking? It's not enough with all those birds and eight
maids-a-milking, but they brought along their goddamned cows. There is
shit all over my lawn, and I can't move around in my own house.

Just lay off me,
Dori

 - - - - - -

Dec. 22, 1995

Hey Shithead,
What are you? Some kind of sadist? Now there's nine pipers playing,
and do they play. They've never stopped chasing those maids since they
got here. The cows are getting upset and they're stepping all over
those screeching birds. What am I going to do? The neighbors have
started a petition to evict me.

You'll get yours,
Dori

- - - - - - -

Dec. 23, 1995

You Rotten Prick,
Now there are ten ladies dancing. I don't know why they call these 
sluts ladies. They've been balling those pipers all night long. Now
the cows can't sleep and they've got diarrhea. My living room is a
river of shit.  The Commissioner of Buildings has subpeoned me to give
cause why the building shouldn't be condemned. I'm siccing the police
in you.

One who means it!

- - - - - - -

Dec. 24, 1995

Listen Fuckhead,
What's with the eleven lords-a-leaping on those maids and ladies. 
Some of those broads will never walk again. Those pipers ran through
the maids and are committing sodomy with the cows. All 23 of the birds
are dead. They've been trampled to death in the orgy. I hope you're
satisfied you rotten bastard.

Your sworn enemy.

Dec. 26, 1995

Dear Sir,
This is to acknowledge your latest gift of twelve drummers drumming,
which you have seen fit to inflict upon our client, Miss Dori
Drawers.The destruction, of course, was total. All further
correspondence should come to our attention. If you should attempt to

                1764 EDITOR'S NOTE

The present Edition of this Book has not only been collated with 
the first three Editions, which were published during the 
Author's Life, but also has the Advantage of his last Corrections 
and  Improvements, from a Copy delivered by him to Mr. Peter 
Coste, communicated  to  the  Editor,  and  now lodged in Christ 
College, Cambridge.




                             PREFACE

Reader, thou hast here the beginning and end of a discourse 
concerning government; what fate has otherwise disposed of the 
papers that should have filled up the middle, and were more than 
all the rest, it is not worth while to tell thee.  These, which 
remain, I hope are sufficient to establish the throne of our 
great restorer, our present King William; to make good his title, 
in the consent of the people, which being the only one of all 
lawful governments, he has more fully and clearly, than any 
prince in Christendom; and to justify to the world the people of 
England, whose love of their just and natural rights, with their 
resolution to preserve them, saved the nation when it was on the 
very brink of slavery and ruin.  If these papers have that 
evidence, I flatter myself is to be found in them, there will be 
no great miss of those which are lost, and my reader may be 
satisfied without them: for I imagine, I shall have neither the 
time, nor inclination to repeat my pains, and fill up the wanting 
part of my answer, by tracing Sir Robert again, through all the 
windings and obscurities, which are to be met with in the several 
branches of his wonderful system.  The king, and body of the 
nation, have since so thoroughly confuted his Hypothesis, that I 
suppose no body hereafter will have either the confidence to 
appear against our common safety, and be again an advocate for 
slavery; or the weakness to be deceived with contradictions 
dressed up in a popular stile, and well-turned periods: for if 
any one will be at the pains, himself, in those parts, which are 
here untouched, to strip Sir Robert's discourses of the flourish 
of doubtful expressions, and endeavour to reduce his words to 
direct, positive, intelligible propositions, and then compare 
them one with another, he will quickly be satisfied, there was 
never so much glib nonsense put together in well-sounding 
English.  If he think it not worth while to examine his works all 
thro', let him make an experiment in that part, where he treats 
of usurpation; and let him try, whether he can, with all his 
skill, make Sir Robert intelligible, and consistent with himself, 
or common sense.  I should not speak so plainly of a gentleman, 
long since past answering, had not the pulpit, of late years, 
publicly owned his doctrine, and made it the current divinity of 
the times.  It is necessary those men, who taking on them to be 
teachers, have so dangerously misled others, should  be  openly  
shewed  of  what authority this their Patriarch is, whom they 
have so blindly followed, that so they may either retract what 
upon so ill grounds they have vented, and cannot be maintained; 
or else justify those principles which they preached up for 
gospel; though they had no better an author than an English 
courtier: for I should not have writ against Sir Robert, or taken 
the pains to shew his mistakes, inconsistencies, and want of 
(what he so much boasts of, and pretends wholly to build on) 
scripture-proofs, were there not men amongst us, who, by crying 
up his books, and espousing his doctrine, save me from the 
reproach of writing against a dead adversary.  They have been so 
zealous in this point, that, if I have done him any wrong, I 
cannot hope they should spare me.  I wish, where they have done 
the truth and the public wrong, they would be as ready to redress 
it, and allow its just weight to this reflection, viz. that there 
cannot be done a greater mischief to prince and people, than the 
propagating wrong notions concerning government; that so at last 
all times might not have reason to complain of the Drum 
Ecclesiastic.  If any one, concerned really for truth, undertake 
the confutation of my Hypothesis, I promise him either to recant  
my mistake, upon fair conviction; or to answer his difficulties.  
But he must remember two things.

     First, That cavilling here and there, at some expression, or 
little incident of my discourse, is not an answer to my book.

     Secondly, That I shall not take railing for arguments, nor 
think either of these worth my notice, though I shall always look 
on myself as bound to give satisfaction to any one, who shall 
appear to be conscientiously scrupulous in the point, and shall 
shew any just grounds for his scruples.

     I have nothing more, but to advertise the reader, that 
Observations stands for Observations on Hobbs, Milton, &c. and 
that a bare quotation of pages always means pages of his 
Patriarcha, Edition 1680.



                        OF CIVIL-GOVERNMENT

                             Book II

Chap. I. Sect. 1. It having been shewn in the foregoing 
discourse,
     1. That Adam had not, either by natural right of 
fatherhood, or by positive donation from God, any  such  
authority  over  his children, or dominion over the world, as is 
pretended:
     2. That if he had, his heirs, yet, had no right to it:
     3. That if his heirs had, there being no law of nature nor 
positive law of God that determines which is the right heir in 
all cases that may arise, the right of succession, and 
consequently of bearing rule, could not have been certainly 
determined:
     4. That if even that had been determined, yet the knowledge 
of which is the eldest line of Adam's posterity, being so long 
since utterly lost, that in the races of mankind and families of 
the world, there remains not to one above another, the least 
pretence to be the eldest house, and to have the right of 
inheritance:
    All these premises having, as I think, been clearly made out, 
it is impossible that the rulers now on earth should make any 
benefit, or derive any the least shadow of authority from that, 
which is held to be the fountain of all power, Adam's private 
dominion and paternal jurisdiction; so that he that will not 
give just occasion to think that all government in the world is 
the product only of force and violence, and that men live 
together by no other rules but that of beasts, where the 
strongest carries it, and so lay a foundation for perpetual 
disorder and mischief, tumult, sedition and rebellion, (things 
that the followers of that hypothesis so loudly cry out against) 
must of necessity find out another rise of government, another 
original of political power, and another way of designing and 
knowing the persons that have it, than what Sir Robert Filmer 
hath taught us.
     Sect. 2. To this purpose, I think it may not be amiss, to 
set down what I take to be political power; that the power of a 
MAGISTRATE over a subject may be distinguished from that of a 
FATHER over his children, a MASTER over his servant, a HUSBAND 
over his wife, and a LORD over his slave.  All which distinct 
powers happening sometimes together in the same man, if he be 
considered under these different relations, it may help us to 
distinguish these powers one from wealth, a father of a family, 
and a captain of a galley.
     Sect. 3. POLITICAL POWER, then, I take to be a RIGHT of 
making laws with penalties of death, and consequently all less 
penalties, for the regulating and preserving of property, and of 
employing the force of the community, in the execution of such 
laws, and in the defence of the common-wealth from foreign 
injury; and all this only for the public good.




                           C H A P. I I.

                    Of the State of Nature.

     Sect. 4. TO understand political power right, and derive it 
from its original, we must consider, what state all men are 
naturally in, and that is, a state of perfect freedom to order 
their actions, and dispose of their possessions and persons, as 
they think fit, within the bounds of the law of nature, without 
asking leave, or depending upon the will of any other man.
     A state also of equality, wherein all the power and 
jurisdiction is reciprocal, no one having more than another; 
there being nothing more evident, than that creatures of the same 
species and rank, promiscuously born to all the same advantages 
of nature, and the use of the same faculties, should also be 
equal one amongst another without subordination or subjection, 
unless the lord and master of them all should, by any manifest 
declaration of his will, set one above another, and confer on 
him, by an evident and clear appointment, an undoubted right to 
dominion and sovereignty.
     Sect. 5. This equality of men by nature, the judicious 
Hooker looks upon as so evident in itself, and beyond all 
question, that he makes it the foundation of that obligation to 
mutual love amongst men, on which he builds the duties they owe 
one another, and from whence he derives the great maxims of 
justice and charity. His words are,
     The like natural inducement hath brought men to know 
   that it is no less their duty, to love others than 
   themselves; for seeing those things which are equal, must 
   needs all have one measure; if I cannot but wish to 
   receive good, even as much at every man's hands, as any 
   man can wish unto his own soul, how should I look to have 
   any part of my desire herein satisfied, unless myself be 
   careful to satisfy the like desire, which is undoubtedly 
   in other men, being of one and the same nature? To have 
   any thing offered them repugnant to this desire, must 
   needs in all respects grieve them as much as me; so that 
   if I do harm, I must look to suffer, there being no 
   reason that others should shew greater measure of love 
   to me, than they have by me shewed unto them: my desire 
   therefore to be loved of my equals in nature as much as 
   possible may be, imposeth upon  me  a  natural duty of 
   bearing to them-ward fully the like affection; from which 
   relation of equality between ourselves and them that are  
   as ourselves, what several rules and canons natural 
   reason  hath drawn, for direction of life, no man is 
   ignorant, Eccl. Pol. Lib. 1.
     Sect. 6. But though this be a state of liberty, yet it is 
not a state of licence: though man in that state have an 
uncontroulable liberty to dispose of his person or possessions, 
yet he has not liberty  to destroy himself, or so much as any 
creature in his possession, but where some nobler use than its 
bare preservation calls for it.  The state of nature has a law 
of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, 
which is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, 
that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm 
another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions: for men 
being all the workmanship of one  omnipotent,  and  infinitely  
wise maker; all the servants of one sovereign master, sent into 
the world by his order, and about his business; they are his 
property, whose workmanship they are, made to last during his, 
not one  another's pleasure: and being furnished with like 
faculties, sharing all in one community of nature,  there  cannot  
be  supposed  any such  subordination among us, that may 
authorize us to destroy one another, as if we were made for one 
another's uses, as the inferior ranks of creatures are for our's.  
Every one, as he is bound  to  preserve himself, and not to 
quit his station wilfully, so by the like reason, when his own 
preservation comes not in competition, ought he,  as much as he 
can, to preserve the rest of mankind, and  may  not, unless it 
be to do justice on an offender, take away, or impair the life, 
or what tends to the preservation of the life, the liberty, 
health, limb, or goods of another.
    Sect. 7.  And that all men may be restrained from invading 
others rights, and from doing hurt to one another, and the law of 
nature be observed, which willeth the peace and preservation of 
all mankind, the execution of the law of nature is, in that 
state, put into every man's hands, whereby every one has a right 
to punish the  transgressors of that law to such a degree, as may 
hinder its violation: for the law of nature would, as all other 
laws that concern men in this world 'be in vain, if there were no 
body that in the state of nature had a power to execute that 
law, and thereby preserve the innocent and restrain offenders.  
And if any one in the state of nature may punish another for any 
evil he has done, every one may do so: for in that state of 
perfect equality, where naturally there is no superiority or 
jurisdiction of one over another, what any may do in prosecution 
of that law, every one must needs have a right to do.      
     Sect. 8. And thus, in the state of nature, one man comes by 
a power over another; but yet no absolute or arbitrary power, to 
use a criminal, when he has got him in his hands, according to 
the passionate heats, or boundless extravagancy of his own will; 
but only to retribute to him, so far as calm reason and 
conscience dictate, what is proportionate to his transgression, 
which is so much as may serve for reparation and restraint: 
for these two are the only reasons, why one man may lawfully do 
harm to another, which is that we call punishment. In 
transgressing the law of nature, the offender declares himself to 
live by another rule than that of reason and common equity, which 
is that measure God has set to the actions of men, for their 
mutual security; and so  he  becomes dangerous to mankind, the 
tye, which is to secure them from injury and violence, being 
slighted and broken by him.  Which being a trespass against the 
whole species, and the peace and safety of it, provided for by 
the law of nature, every man upon this score, by the right he 
hath to preserve mankind in general, may restrain, or where it is 
necessary, destroy things noxious to them, and so may bring such 
evil on any one, who hath transgressed that law, as may make him 
repent the doing of it, and thereby deter him, and by his example 
others, from doing the like mischief.  And in the case, and upon 
this ground, EVERY MAN HATH A RIGHT TO PUNISH THE OFFENDER, AND 
BE EXECUTIONER OF THE LAW OF NATURE.
     Sect. 9. 1 doubt not but this will seem a very strange 
doctrine to some men: but before they condemn it, I desire them 
to resolve me, by what right any prince or state can put to 
death, or punish an alien, for any crime he commits in their 
country.  It is certain their laws, by virtue of any sanction 
they receive from the promulgated will of the legislative, reach 
not a stranger: they speak not to him, nor, if they did, is he 
bound to hearken to them.  The legislative authority, by which 
they are in force over the subjects of that commonwealth, hath no 
power over him.   Those  who  have  the supreme power of making 
laws in England, France or Holland, are to an Indian, but 
like the rest of the world, men without authority: and therefore, 
if by the law of nature every man hath not a power to punish 
offences against it, as he soberly judges the case to require, I 
see not how the magistrates of any community can punish an 
alien of another country; since, in reference to him, they can 
have no more power than what every man naturally may have over 
another.
     Sect, 10. Besides the crime which consists in violating the 
law, and varying from the right rule of reason, whereby a man so  
far becomes degenerate, and declares himself to quit the 
principles of human nature, and to be a noxious creature, there 
is commonly injury done to some person or other, and some other 
man receives damage by his transgression: in which case he who 
hath received any damage, has, besides the right of punishment 
common to him with other men, a particular right to seek 
reparation from him that has done it: and any other person, who 
finds it just, may also join with him that is injured, and assist 
him in recovering from the offender so much as may make 
satisfaction for the harm he has suffered.
     Sect. 11. From these two distinct rights, the one of 
punishing the crime for restraint, and preventing the like 
offence, which right of punishing is in every body; the other of 
taking reparation, which belongs only to the injured party, 
comes it to pass that the magistrate, who by being magistrate 
hath the common  right  of punishing put into his hands, can 
often, where the public good demands not the execution of the 
law, remit the punishment of criminal offences by his own 
authority, but yet cannot remit the satisfaction due to any 
private man for the damage he has received.  That, he who has 
suffered the damage has a right to demand in his own name, and he 
alone can remit: the damnified person has this power of 
appropriating to himself the goods or service of the offender, 
by right of self-preservation, as every man has a power to 
punish the crime, to prevent its being committed again, by the 
right he has of preserving all mankind, and doing all reasonable 
things he can in order to that end: and thus it is, that every 
man, in the state of nature, has a power to kill a murderer, both 
to deter others from doing the like injury, which no reparation 
can compensate, by the example of the punishment that attends it 
from every body, and also to secure men from the attempts of a 
criminal, who having renounced reason, the common rule and 
measure God hath given to mankind, hath, by the unjust violence 
and slaughter he hath committed upon one, declared war against 
all mankind, and therefore may be destroyed as a lion or a 
tyger, one of those wild savage beasts, with whom men can have 
no society nor security: and upon this is grounded that great law 
of nature, Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be 
shed. And Cain was so fully convinced, that every one had a 
right to destroy such a criminal, that after the murder of his 
brother, he cries out, Every one that findeth me, shall slay 
me; so plain was it writ in the hearts of all mankind.
     Sect. 12. By the same reason may a man in the state of 
nature punish the lesser breaches of that law.  It will perhaps 
be demanded, with death? I answer, each transgression may be 
punished to that degree, and with so much severity, as will 
suffice to make it an ill bargain to the offender, give him cause 
to repent, and terrify others from doing the like.  Every 
offence, that can be committed in the state of nature, may in the 
state of nature be also punished equally, and as far forth as it 
may, in a commonwealth: for though it would be besides my present 
purpose, to enter here into the particulars of the law of nature, 
or its measures of punishment; yet, it is certain there is such 
a law, and that too, as intelligible and plain to a rational 
creature, and a studier of that law, as the positive laws of 
commonwealths; nay, possibly plainer; as much as reason is easier 
to be understood, than the fancies and intricate contrivances of 
men, following contrary and hidden interests put into words; for 
so truly are a great part of the municipal laws of countries, 
which are only so far right, as they are founded on the law of 
nature, by which they are to be regulated and interpreted.  

     Sect. 13. To this strange doctrine, viz. That in the 
state of nature every one has the executive power of the law of 
nature, I doubt not but it will be objected, that it is 
unreasonable for men to be judges in their own cases, that self-
love will make men partial to themselves and their friends: and 
on the other side, that ill nature, passion and revenge will 
carry them too far in punishing others; and  hence nothing but 
confusion and disorder will follow, and that therefore God hath 
certainly appointed government to restrain the partiality and 
violence of men.  I easily grant, that civil government is the 
proper remedy for the inconveniencies of the state of nature, 
which must certainly be great, where men may be judges in their 
own case, since it is easy to be imagined, that he who was so 
unjust as to do his brother an injury, will scarce be so just as 
to condemn himself for it: but I shall desire those who make this 
objection, to remember, that absolute monarchs are but men; and 
if government is to be  the remedy of those evils, which 
necessarily follow from men's being judges in their own cases, 
and the state of nature is therefore not to how much better it is 
than the state of nature, where one man, commanding a multitude, 
has the liberty to be judge in his own case, and may do to all 
his subjects whatever he pleases, without the least liberty to 
any one to question or controul those who execute his pleasure7 
and in whatsoever he  cloth,  whether  led  by  reason, mistake 
or passion, must be submitted to7 much better it is in the state 
of nature, wherein men are not bound to submit to the unjust will 
of another: and if he that judges, judges amiss in his own, or 
any other case, he is answerable for it to the rest of mankind.
     Sect. 14. It is often asked as a mighty objection, where 
are, or ever were there any men in such a state of nature? To 
which it may suffice as an answer at present, that since all 
princes and rulers of independent governments all through the 
world, are in a  state  of nature, it is plain the world never 
was, nor ever will be, without numbers of men in that state.  I 
have named all governors of independent communities, whether 
they are, or are  not,  in  league with others: for it is not 
every compact that puts an end to the state of nature between 
men, but only this one  of  agreeing  together mutually to enter 
into one community, and make one body politic; other promises, 
and compacts, men  may  make  one  with  another, and yet still 
be in the state of nature.  The promises and bargains for truck, 
&c. between the two men in the desert island, mentioned by 
Garcilasso de la Vega, in his history of Peru; or between a 
Swiss and an Indian, in the woods of America, are binding 
to them, though they are perfectly in a state of nature, in 
reference to one another: for truth and keeping of faith belongs 
to men, as men, and not as members of society.
     Sect. 15. To those that say, there were never any men in the 
state of nature, I will not only oppose the authority  of  the  
judicious Hooker, Eccl. Pol. lib. i. sect. 10, where he says, 
The laws which have been hitherto mentioned, i.e. the laws of 
nature, do bind men absolutely, even as they are men, although 
they have never any settled fellowship, never  any  solemn  
agreement  amongst  themselves what to do, or not to do: but 
forasmuch as we are not by ourselves sufficient to furnish 
ourselves with competent store of things, needful for such a life 
as our nature doth desire, a life fit for the dignity of man; 
therefore to supply those defects and imperfections which are in 
us, as living single and solely by ourselves, we are naturally 
induced to seek communion and fellowship with  others:  this  was 
the cause of men's uniting themselves at first in politic 
societies.  But I moreover affirm, that all men are  naturally  
in  that  state,  and  remain so, till by their own consents they 
make themselves members of some politic society; and I doubt not 
in the sequel of this discourse, to make it very clear.

                          C H A P. I I I.
                                
                     Of the State of War.

     16. THE state of war is a state of enmity and 
destruction: and therefore declaring by word or action, not a 
passionate and hasty, but a sedate settled design upon another 
man's life, puts him in a state of war with him against whom he 
has declared such an intention, and so has exposed his life to 
the other's power to be taken away by him, or any one that joins 
with him in his defence, and espouses his quarrel; it being 
reasonable and just, I should have a right to destroy that which 
threatens me with destruction: for, by the fundamental law of 
nature, man being to be preserved as much as possible, when all 
cannot be preserved, the safety of the innocent is to be 
preferred: and one may destroy a man who makes war upon him, or 
has discovered an enmity to his being, for the same reason that 
he may kill a wolf or a lion; because such men are not under 
the ties of the commonlaw of reason, have no other rule, but that 
of force and violence, and so may be treated as beasts of prey, 
those dangerous and noxious creatures, that will be sure to 
destroy him whenever he falls into their power.
     Sect, 17. And hence it is, that he who attempts to get 
another man into his absolute power, does thereby put himself 
into a state of war with him; it being to be understood as a 
declaration of a design upon his life: for I have reason to 
conclude, that he who would get me into his power without my 
consent, would use me as he pleased when he had got me there, and 
destroy me too when he had a fancy to it; for no body can desire 
to have me in his absolute power, unless it be to compel me by 
force to that which is against the right of my freedom, i.e. 
make me a slave.  To be free from such force is the only security 
of my preservation; and reason bids me look on him, as an enemy 
to my preservation, who would take away that freedom which is 
the fence to it; so that he who makes an attempt to enslave me, 
thereby puts himself into a state of war with me.  He that, in 
the state of nature, would take away the freedom that belongs 
to any one in that state, must necessarily be supposed to have a 
foundationtofeallathevrest;hasghelthat,hin theestateeofgsociety, 
would take away the freedom belonging to those of that society 
or commonwealth, must be supposed to design to take away from 
them every thing else, and so be looked on as in a state of war.
     Sec. 18.  This makes it lawful for a man to kill a thief, 
who has not in the least hurt him, nor declared any design upon 
his life, any farther than, by the use of force, so to get him in 
his power, as to take away his money, or what he pleases, from 
him; because using force, where he has no right, to get me into 
his power, let his pretence be what it will, I have no reason to 
suppose, that he, who would take away my liberty, would not, 
when he had me in his power, take away every thing else.  And 
therefore it is lawful for me to treat him as one who has put 
himself into a state of war with me, i.e.  kill him if I can; 
for to that hazard does he justly expose himself, whoever 
introduces a state of war, and is aggressor in it.
     Sec. 19.  And here we have the plain difference between the 
state of nature and the state of war, which however some men 
have confounded, are as far distant, as a state of peace, good 
will, mutual assistance and preservation, and a state of enmity, 
malice, violence and mutual destruction, are one from another.  
Men living together according to reason, without a common 
superior on earth, with authority to judge between them, is 
properly the state of nature.  But force, or a declared design 
of force, upon the person of another, where there is no common 
superior on earth to appeal to for relief, is the state of war: 
and it is the want of such an appeal gives a man the right of war 
even against an aggressor, tho' he be in society and a fellow 
subject.  Thus a thief, whom I cannot harm, but by appeal to 
the law, for having stolen all that I am worth, I may kill, when 
he sets on me to rob me but of my horse or coat; because the law, 
which was made for my preservation, where it cannot interpose to 
secure my life from present force, which, if lost, is capable of 
no reparation, permits me my own defence, and the right of war, a 
liberty to kill the aggressor, because the aggressor allows not 
time to appeal to our common judge, nor the decision of the law, 
for remedy in a case where the mischief may be irreparable.  Want 
of a common judge with authority, puts all men in a state of 
nature: force without right, upon a man's person, makes a state 
of war, both where there is, and is not, a common judge.
     Sec. 20.  But when the actual force is over, the state of 
war ceases between those that are in society, and are equally on 
both sides subjected to the fair determination of the law; 
because then there lies open the remedy of appeal for the past 
injury, and to prevent future harm: but where no such appeal is, 
as in the state of nature, for want of positive laws, and judges 
with authority to appeal to, the state of war once begun, 
continues, with a right to the innocent party to destroy the 
other whenever he can, until the aggressor offers peace, and 
desires reconciliation on such terms as may repair any wrongs he 
has already done, and secure the innocent for the future; nay, 
where an appeal to the law, and constituted judges, lies open, 
but the remedy is denied by a manifest perverting of justice, and 
a barefaced wresting of the laws to protect or indemnify the 
violence or injuries of some men, or party of men, there it is 
hard to imagine any thing but a state of war: for wherever 
violence is used, and injury done, though by hands appointed to 
administer justice, it is still violence and injury, however 
coloured with the name, pretences, or forms of law, the end 
whereof being to protect and redress the innocent, by an 
unbiassed application of it, to all who are under it; wherever 
that is not bona fide done, war is made upon the sufferers, who 
having no appeal on earth to right them, they are left to the 
only remedy in such cases, an appeal to heaven.
     Sec. 21.  To avoid this state of war (wherein there is no 
appeal but to heaven, and wherein every the least difference is 
apt to end, where there is no authority to decide between the 
contenders) is one great reason of men's putting themselves into 
society, and quitting the state of nature: for where there is an 
authority, a power on earth, from which relief can be had by 
appeal, there the continuance of the state of war is excluded, 
and the controversy is decided by that power.  Had there been any 
such court, any superior jurisdiction on earth, to determine the 
right between Jephtha and the Ammonites, they had never come to a 
state of war: but we see he was forced to appeal to heaven.  The 
Lord the Judge (says he) be judge this day between the children 
of Israel and the children of Ammon, Judg.  xi.  27.  and then 
prosecuting, and relying on his appeal, he leads out his army to 
battle: and therefore in such controversies, where the question 
is put, who shall be judge?  It cannot be meant, who shall decide 
the controversy; every one knows what Jephtha here tells us, that 
the Lord the Judge shall judge.  Where there is no judge on 
earth, the appeal lies to God in heaven.  That question then 
cannot mean, who shall judge, whether another hath put himself in 
a state of war with me, and whether I may, as Jephtha did, appeal 
to heaven in it? of that I myself can only be judge in my own 
conscience, as I will answer it, at the great day, to the supreme 
judge of all men.



                          CHAP.  IV.

                          Of SLAVERY.

     Sec. 22.  THE natural liberty of man is to be free from any 
superior power on earth, and not to be under the will or 
legislative authority of man, but to have only the law of nature 
for his rule.  The liberty of man, in society, is to be under no 
other legislative power, but that established, by consent, in the 
commonwealth; nor under the dominion of any will, or restraint of 
any law, but what that legislative shall enact, according to the 
trust put in it.  Freedom then is not what Sir Robert Filmer 
tells us, Observations, A. 55. a liberty for every one to do what 
he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws: 
but freedom of men under government is, to have a standing rule 
to live by, common to every one of that society, and made by the 
legislative power erected in it; a liberty to follow my own will 
in all things, where the rule prescribes not; and not to be 
subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of 
another man: as freedom of nature is, to be under no other 
restraint but the law of nature.
     Sec. 23.  This freedom from absolute, arbitrary power, is 
so necessary to, and closely joined with a man's preservation, 
that he cannot part with it, but by what forfeits his 
preservation and life together: for a man, not having the power 
of his own life, cannot, by compact, or his own consent, 
enslave himself to any one, nor put himself under the absolute, 
arbitrary power of another, to take away his life, when he 
pleases.  No body can give more power than he has himself; and he 
that cannot take away his own life, cannot give another power 
over it.  Indeed, having by his fault forfeited his own life, by 
some act that deserves death; he, to whom he has forfeited it, 
may (when he has him in his power) delay to take it, and make use 
of him to his own service, and he does him no injury by it: for, 
whenever he finds the hardship of his slavery outweigh the value 
of his life, it is in his power, by resisting the will of his 
master, to draw on himself the death he desires.
     Sec. 24.  This is the perfect condition of slavery, which 
is nothing else, but the state of war continued, between a 
lawful conqueror and a captive: for, if once compact enter 
between them, and make an agreement for a limited power on the 
one side, and obedience on the other, the state of war and 
slavery ceases, as long as the compact endures: for, as has been 
said, no man can, by agreement, pass over to another that which 
he hath not in himself, a power over his own life.
 I confess, we find among the Jews, as well as other nations, 
that men did sell themselves; but, it is plain, this was only to 
drudgery, not to slavery: for, it is evident, the person sold 
was not under an absolute, arbitrary, despotical power: for the 
master could not have power to kill him, at any time, whom, at a 
certain time, he was obliged to let go free out of his service; 
and the master of such a servant was so far from having an 
arbitrary power over his life, that he could not, at pleasure, so 
much as maim him, but the loss of an eye, or tooth, set him free, 
Exod. xxi.



                        CHAP.  V.

                      Of PROPERTY.

     Sec. 25.  Whether we consider natural reason, which tells 
us, that men, being once born, have a right to their 
preservation, and consequently to meat and drink, and such other 
things as nature affords for their subsistence: or revelation, 
which gives us an account of those grants God made of the world 
to Adam, and to Noah, and his sons, it is very clear, that 
God, as king David says, Psal. cxv.  16.  has given the 
earth to the children of men; given it to mankind in common.  But 
this being supposed, it seems to some a very great difficulty, 
how any one should ever come to have a property in any thing: I 
will not content myself to answer, that if it be difficult to 
make out property, upon a supposition that God gave the world 
to Adam, and his posterity in common, it is impossible that any 
man, but one universal monarch, should have any property upon a 
supposition, that God gave the world to Adam, and his heirs in 
succession, exclusive of all the rest of his posterity.  But I 
shall endeavour to shew, how men might come to have a property 
in several parts of that which God gave to mankind in common, and 
that without any express compact of all the commoners.
     Sec. 26.  God, who hath given the world to men in common, 
hath also given them reason to make use of it to the best 
advantage of life, and convenience.  The earth, and all that is 
therein, is given to men for the support and comfort of their 
being.  And tho' all the fruits it naturally produces, and beasts 
it feeds, belong to mankind in common, as they are produced by 
the spontaneous hand of nature; and no body has originally a 
private dominion, exclusive of the rest of mankind, in any of 
them, as they are thus in their natural state: yet being given 
for the use of men, there must of necessity be a means to 
appropriate them some way or other, before they can be of any 
use, or at all beneficial to any particular man.  The fruit, or 
venison, which nourishes the wild Indian, who knows no 
enclosure, and is still a tenant in common, must be his, and so 
his, i.e. a part of him, that another can no longer have any 
right to it, before it can do him any good for the support of his 
life.
     Sec. 27.  Though the earth, and all inferior creatures, be 
common to all men, yet every man has a property in his own 
person: this no body has any right to but himself.  The 
labour of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, 
are properly his.  Whatsoever then he removes out of the state 
that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his 
labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and 
thereby makes it his property.  It being by him removed from 
the common state nature hath placed it in, it hath by this 
labour something annexed to it, that excludes the common right 
of other men: for this labour being the unquestionable property 
of the labourer, no man but he can have a right to what that is 
once joined to, at least where there is enough, and as good, left 
in common for others.
     Sec. 28.  He that is nourished by the acorns he picked up 
under an oak, or the apples he gathered from the trees in the 
wood, has certainly appropriated them to himself.  No body can 
deny but the nourishment is his.  I ask then, when did they begin 
to be his? when he digested? or when he eat? or when he boiled? 
or when he brought them home? or when he picked them up? and it 
is plain, if the first gathering made them not his, nothing else 
could.  That labour put a distinction between them and common: 
that added something to them more than nature, the common mother 
of all, had done; and so they became his private right.  And will 
any one say, he had no right to those acorns or apples, he thus 
appropriated, because he had not the consent of all mankind to 
make them his?  Was it a robbery thus to assume to himself what 
belonged to all in common?  If such a consent as that was 
necessary, man had starved, notwithstanding the plenty God had 
given him.  We see in commons, which remain so by compact, that 
it is the taking any part of what is common, and removing it out 
of the state nature leaves it in, which begins the property; 
without which the common is of no use.  And the taking of this or 
that part, does not depend on the express consent of all the 
commoners.  Thus the grass my horse has bit; the turfs my servant 
has cut; and the ore I have digged in any place, where I have a 
right to them in common with others, become my property, 
without the assignation or consent of any body.  The labour 
that was mine, removing them out of that common state they were 
in, hath fixed my property in them.
     Sec. 29.  By making an explicit consent of every commoner, 
necessary to any one's appropriating to himself any part of what 
is given in common, children or servants could not cut the meat, 
which their father or master had provided for them in common, 

without assigning to every one his peculiar part.  Though the 
water running in the fountain be every one's, yet who can doubt, 
but that in the pitcher is his only who drew it out?  His 
labour hath taken it out of the hands of nature, where it was 
common, and belonged equally to all her children, and hath 
thereby appropriated it to himself.
     Sec. 30.  Thus this law of reason makes the deer that 
Indian's who hath killed it; it is allowed to be his goods, who 
hath bestowed his labour upon it, though before it was the common 
right of every one.  And amongst those who are counted the 
civilized part of mankind, who have made and multiplied positive 
laws to determine property, this original law of nature, for 
the beginning of property, in what was before common, still 
takes place; and by virtue thereof, what fish any one catches in 
the ocean, that great and still remaining common of mankind; or 
what ambergrise any one takes up here, is by the labour that 
removes it out of that common state nature left it in, made his 
property, who takes that pains about it.  And even amongst us, 
the hare that any one is hunting, is thought his who pursues her 
during the chase: for being a beast that is still looked upon as 
common, and no man's private possession; whoever has employed so 
much labour about any of that kind, as to find and pursue her, 
has thereby removed her from the state of nature, wherein she was 
common, and hath begun a property.
     Sec. 31.  It will perhaps be objected to this, that if 
gathering the acorns, or other fruits of the earth, &c. makes a 
right to them, then any one may ingross as much as he will.  To 
which I answer, Not so.  The same law of nature, that does by 
this means give us property, does also bound that property 
too.  God has given us all things richly, 1 Tim.  vi.  12.  is 
the voice of reason confirmed by inspiration.  But how far has he 
given it us?  To enjoy.  As much as any one can make use of to 
any advantage of life before it spoils, so much he may by his 
Tabour fix a property in: whatever is beyond this, is more than 
his share, and belongs to others.  Nothing was made by God for 
man to spoil or destroy.  And thus, considering the plenty of 
natural provisions there was a long time in the world, and the 
few spenders; and to how small a part of that provision the 
industry of one man could extend itself, and ingross it to the 
prejudice of others; especially keeping within the bounds, set 
by reason, of what might serve for his use; there could be then 
little room for quarrels or contentions about property so 
established.
     Sec. 32.  But the chief matter of property being now not 
the fruits of the earth, and the beasts that subsist on it, but 
the earth itself; as that which takes in and carries with it 
all the rest; I think it is plain, that property in that too is 
acquired as the former.  As much land as a man tills, plants, 
improves, cultivates, and can use the product of, so much is his 
property.  He by his labour does, as it were, inclose it from 
the common.  Nor will it invalidate his right, to say every body 
else has an equal title to it; and therefore he cannot 
appropriate, he cannot inclose, without the consent of all his 
fellow-commoners, all mankind.  God, when he gave the world in 
common to all mankind, commanded man also to labour, and the 
penury of his condition required it of him.  God and his reason 
commanded him to subdue the earth, i.e. improve it for the 
benefit of life, and therein lay out something upon it that was 
his own, his labour.  He that in obedience to this command of 
God, subdued, tilled and sowed any part of it, thereby annexed to 
it something that was his property, which another had no title 
to, nor could without injury take from him.
     Sec. 33.  Nor was this appropriation of any parcel of 
land, by improving it, any prejudice to any other man, since 
there was still enough, and as good left; and more than the yet 
unprovided could use.  So that, in effect, there was never the 

less left for others because of his enclosure for himself: for he 
that leaves as much as another can make use of, does as good as 
take nothing at all.  No body could think himself injured by the 
drinking of another man, though he took a good draught, who had a 
whole river of the same water left him to quench his thirst: and 
the case of land and water, where there is enough of both, is 
perfectly the same.
     Sec. 34.  God gave the world to men in common; but since he 
gave it them for their benefit, and the greatest conveniencies of 
life they were capable to draw from it, it cannot be supposed he 
meant it should always remain common and uncultivated.  He gave 
it to the use of the industrious and rational, (and labour was 
to be his title to it;) not to the fancy or covetousness of the 
quarrelsome and contentious.  He that had as good left for his 
improvement, as was already taken up, needed not complain, ought 
not to meddle with what was already improved by another's labour: 
if he did, it is plain he desired the benefit of another's pains, 
which he had no right to, and not the ground which God had given 
him in common with others to labour on, and whereof there was as 
good left, as that already possessed, and more than he knew what 
to do with, or his industry could reach to.
     Sec. 35.  It is true, in land that is common in 
England, or any other country, where there is plenty of people 
under government, who have money and commerce, no one can inclose 
or appropriate any part, without the consent of all his fellow-
commoners; because this is left common by compact, i.e. by the 
law of the land, which is not to be violated.  And though it be 
common, in respect of some men, it is not so to all mankind; but 
is the joint property of this country, or this parish.  Besides, 
the remainder, after such enclosure, would not be as good to the 
rest of the commoners, as the whole was when they could all make 
use of the whole; whereas in the beginning and first peopling of 
the great common of the world, it was quite otherwise.  The law 
man was under, was rather for appropriating.  God commanded, and 
his wants forced him to labour.  That was his property which 
could not be taken from him where-ever he had fixed it.  And 
hence subduing or cultivating the earth, and having dominion, we 
see are joined together.  The one gave title to the other.  So 
that God, by commanding to subdue, gave authority so far to 
appropriate: and the condition of human life, which requires 
labour and materials to work on, necessarily introduces private 
possessions.
     Sec. 36.  The measure of property nature has well set by 
the extent of men's labour and the conveniencies of life: no 
man's labour could subdue, or appropriate all; nor could his 
enjoyment consume more than a small part; so that it was 
impossible for any man, this way, to intrench upon the right of 
another, or acquire to himself a property, to the prejudice of 
his neighbour, who would still have room for as good, and as 
large a possession (after the other had taken out his) as before 
it was appropriated.  This measure did confine every man's 
possession to a very moderate proportion, and such as he might 
appropriate to himself, without injury to any body, in the first 
ages of the world, when men were more in danger to be lost, by 
wandering from their company, in the then vast wilderness of the 
earth, than to be straitened for want of room to plant in.  And 
the same measure may be allowed still without prejudice to any 
body, as full as the world seems: for supposing a man, or family, 
in the state they were at first peopling of the world by the 
children of Adam, or Noah; let him plant in some inland, 
vacant places of America, we shall find that the possessions 
he could make himself, upon the measures we have given, would 
not be very large, nor, even to this day, prejudice the rest of 
mankind, or give them reason to complain, or think themselves 
injured by this man's incroachment, though the race of men have 
now spread themselves to all the corners of the world, and do 

infinitely exceed the small number was at the beginning.  Nay, 
the extent of ground is of so little value, without labour, 
that I have heard it affirmed, that in Spain itself a man may 
be permitted to plough, sow and reap, without being disturbed, 
upon land he has no other title to, but only his making use of 
it.  But, on the contrary, the inhabitants think themselves 
beholden to him, who, by his industry on neglected, and 
consequently waste land, has increased the stock of corn, which 
they wanted.  But be this as it will, which I lay no stress on; 
this I dare boldly affirm, that the same rule of propriety, 
(viz.) that every man should have as much as he could make use 
of, would hold still in the world, without straitening any body; 
since there is land enough in the world to suffice double the 
inhabitants, had not the invention of money, and the tacit 
agreement of men to put a value on it, introduced (by consent) 
larger possessions, and a right to them; which, how it has done, 
I shall by and by shew more at large.
     Sec. 37.  This is certain, that in the beginning, before the 
desire of having more than man needed had altered the intrinsic 
value of things, which depends only on their usefulness to the 
life of man; or had agreed, that a little piece of yellow 
metal, which would keep without wasting or decay, should be 
worth a great piece of flesh, or a whole heap of corn; though men 
had a right to appropriate, by their labour, each one of himself, 
as much of the things of nature, as he could use: yet this could 
not be much, nor to the prejudice of others, where the same 
plenty was still left to those who would use the same industry.  
To which let me add, that he who appropriates land to himself by 
his labour, does not lessen, but increase the common stock of 
mankind: for the provisions serving to the support of human life, 
produced by one acre of inclosed and cultivated land, are (to 
speak much within compass) ten times more than those which are 
yielded by an acre of land of an equal richness lying waste in 
common.  And therefore he that incloses land, and has a greater 
plenty of the conveniencies of life from ten acres, than he could 
have from an hundred left to nature, may truly be said to give 
ninety acres to mankind: for his labour now supplies him with 
provisions out of ten acres, which were but the product of an 
hundred lying in common.  I have here rated the improved land 
very low, in making its product but as ten to one, when it is 
much nearer an hundred to one: for I ask, whether in the wild 
woods and uncultivated waste of America, left to nature, 
without any improvement, tillage or husbandry, a thousand acres 
yield the needy and wretched inhabitants as many conveniencies of 
life, as ten acres of equally fertile land do in Devonshire, 
where they are well cultivated?
     Before the appropriation of land, he who gathered as much of 
the wild fruit, killed, caught, or tamed, as many of the beasts, 
as he could; he that so imployed his pains about any of the 
spontaneous products of nature, as any way to alter them from the 
state which nature put them in, by placing any of his labour 
on them, did thereby acquire a propriety in them: but if they 
perished, in his possession, without their due use; if the fruits 
rotted, or the venison putrified, before he could spend it, he 
offended against the common law of nature, and was liable to be 
punished; he invaded his neighbour's share, for he had no right, 
farther than his use called for any of them, and they might 
serve to afford him conveniencies of life.
     Sec. 38.  The same measures governed the possession of 
land too: whatsoever he tilled and reaped, laid up and made use 
of, before it spoiled, that was his peculiar right; whatsoever he 
enclosed, and could feed, and make use of, the cattle and product 
was also his.  But if either the grass of his enclosure rotted on 
the ground, or the fruit of his planting perished without 
gathering, and laying up, this part of the earth, notwithstanding 
his enclosure, was still to be looked on as waste, and might be 

the possession of any other.  Thus, at the beginning, Cain 
might take as much ground as he could till, and make it his own 
land, and yet leave enough to Abel's sheep to feed on; a few 
acres would serve for both their possessions.  But as families 
increased, and industry inlarged their stocks, their possessions 
inlarged with the need of them; but yet it was commonly without 
any fixed property in the ground they made use of, till they 
incorporated, settled themselves together, and built cities; and 
then, by consent, they came in time, to set out the bounds of 
their distinct territories, and agree on limits between them and 
their neighbours; and by laws within themselves, settled the 
properties of those of the same society: for we see, that in 
that part of the world which was first inhabited, and therefore 
like to be best peopled, even as low down as Abraham's time, 
they wandered with their flocks, and their herds, which was their 
substance, freely up and down; and this Abraham did, in a 
country where he was a stranger.  Whence it is plain, that at 
least a great part of the land lay in common; that the 
inhabitants valued it not, nor claimed property in any more than 
they made use of.  But when there was not room enough in the same 
place, for their herds to feed together, they by consent, as 
Abraham and Lot did, Gen. xiii.  5.  separated and inlarged 
their pasture, where it best liked them.  And for the same reason 
Esau went from his father, and his brother, and planted in 
mount Seir, Gen. xxxvi. 6.
     Sec. 39.  And thus, without supposing any private dominion, 
and property in Adam, over all the world, exclusive of all 
other men, which can no way be proved, nor any one's property be 
made out from it; but supposing the world given, as it was, to 
the children of men in common, we see how labour could make 
men distinct titles to several parcels of it, for their private 
uses; wherein there could be no doubt of right, no room for 
quarrel.
     Sec. 40.  Nor is it so strange, as perhaps before 
consideration it may appear, that the property of labour should 
be able to over-balance the community of land: for it is labour 
indeed that puts the difference of value on every thing; and 
let any one consider what the difference is between an acre of 
land planted with tobacco or sugar, sown with wheat or barley, 
and an acre of the same land lying in common, without any 
husbandry upon it, and he will find, that the improvement of 
labour makes the far greater part of the value.  I think it 
will be but a very modest computation to say, that of the 
products of the earth useful to the life of man nine tenths are 
the effects of labour: nay, if we will rightly estimate things 
as they come to our use, and cast up the several expences about 
them, what in them is purely owing to nature, and what to 
labour, we shall find, that in most of them ninety-nine 
hundredths are wholly to be put on the account of labour.  
     Sec. 41.  There cannot be a clearer demonstration of any 
thing, than several nations of the Americans are of this, who 
are rich in land, and poor in all the comforts of life; whom 
nature having furnished as liberally as any other people, with 
the materials of plenty, i.e. a fruitful soil, apt to produce 
in abundance, what might serve for food, raiment, and delight; 
yet for want of improving it by labour, have not one hundredth 
part of the conveniencies we enjoy: and a king of a large and 
fruitful territory there, feeds, lodges, and is clad worse than a 
day-labourer in England.  
     Sec. 42.  To make this a little clearer, let us but trace 
some of the ordinary provisions of life, through their several 
progresses, before they come to our use, and see how much they 
receive of their value from human industry.  Bread, wine and 
cloth, are things of daily use, and great plenty; yet 
notwithstanding, acorns, water and leaves, or skins, must be our 
bread, drink and cloathing, did not labour furnish us with 

these more useful commodities: for whatever bread is more worth 
than acorns, wine than water, and cloth or silk, than leaves, 
skins or moss, that is wholly owing to labour and industry; 
the one of these being the food and raiment which unassisted 
nature furnishes us with; the other, provisions which our 
industry and pains prepare for us, which how much they exceed the 
other in value, when any one hath computed, he will then see how 
much labour makes the far greatest part of the value of things 
we enjoy in this world: and the ground which produces the 
materials, is scarce to be reckoned in, as any, or at most, but a 
very small part of it; so little, that even amongst us, land that 
is left wholly to nature, that hath no improvement of pasturage, 
tillage, or planting, is called, as indeed it is, waste; and we 
shall find the benefit of it amount to little more than nothing.
 This shews how much numbers of men are to be preferred to 
largeness of dominions; and that the increase of lands, and the 
right employing of them, is the great art of government: and that 
prince, who shall be so wise and godlike, as by established laws 
of liberty to secure protection and encouragement to the honest 
industry of mankind, against the oppression of power and 
narrowness of party, will quickly be too hard for his neighbours: 
but this by the by.  To return to the argument in hand,
     Sec. 43.  An acre of land, that bears here twenty bushels of 
wheat, and another in America, which, with the same husbandry, 
would do the like, are, without doubt, of the same natural 
intrinsic value: but yet the benefit mankind receives from the 
one in a year, is worth 5l.  and from the other possibly not 
worth a penny, if all the profit an Indian received from it were 
to be valued, and sold here; at least, I may truly say, not one 
thousandth.  It is labour then which puts the greatest part of 
value upon land, without which it would scarcely be worth any 
thing: it is to that we owe the greatest part of all its useful 
products; for all that the straw, bran, bread, of that acre of 
wheat, is more worth than the product of an acre of as good land, 
which lies waste, is all the effect of labour: for it is not 
barely the plough-man's pains, the reaper's and thresher's toil, 
and the baker's sweat, is to be counted into the bread we eat; 
the labour of those who broke the oxen, who digged and wrought 
the iron and stones, who felled and framed the timber employed 
about the plough, mill, oven, or any other utensils, which are a 
vast number, requisite to this corn, from its being feed to be 
sown to its being made bread, must all be charged on the 
account of labour, and received as an effect of that: nature and 
the earth furnished only the almost worthless materials, as in 
themselves.  It would be a strange catalogue of things, that 
industry provided and made use of, about every loaf of bread, 
before it came to our use, if we could trace them; iron, wood, 
leather, bark, timber, stone, bricks, coals, lime, cloth, dying 
drugs, pitch, tar, masts, ropes, and all the materials made use 
of in the ship, that brought any of the commodities made use of 
by any of the workmen, to any part of the work; all which it 
would be almost impossible, at least too long, to reckon up.
     Sec. 44.  From all which it is evident, that though the 
things of nature are given in common, yet man, by being master of 
himself, and proprietor of his own person, and the actions or 
labour of it, had still in himself the great foundation of 
property; and that, which made up the great part of what he 
applied to the support or comfort of his being, when invention 
and arts had improved the conveniencies of life, was perfectly 
his own, and did not belong in common to others.
     Sec. 45.  Thus labour, in the beginning, gave a right of 
property, wherever any one was pleased to employ it upon what 
was common, which remained a long while the far greater part, and 
is yet more than mankind makes use of.  Men, at first, for the 
most part, contented themselves with what unassisted nature 
offered to their necessities: and though afterwards, in some 

parts of the world, (where the increase of people and stock, with 
the use of money, had made land scarce, and so of some value) 
the several communities settled the bounds of their distinct 
territories, and by laws within themselves regulated the 
properties of the private men of their society, and so, by 
compact and agreement, settled the property which labour and 
industry began; and the leagues that have been made between 
several states and kingdoms, either expresly or tacitly disowning 
all claim and right to the land in the others possession, have, 
by common consent, given up their pretences to their natural 
common right, which originally they had to those countries, and 
so have, by positive agreement, settled a property amongst 
themselves, in distinct parts and parcels of the earth; yet there 
are still great tracts of ground to be found, which (the 
inhabitants thereof not having joined with the rest of mankind, 
in the consent of the use of their common money) lie waste, and 
are more than the people who dwell on it do, or can make use of, 
and so still lie in common; tho' this can scarce happen amongst 
that part of mankind that have consented to the use of money.
     Sec. 46.  The greatest part of things really useful to the 
life of man, and such as the necessity of subsisting made the 
first commoners of the world look after, as it cloth the 
Americans now, are generally things of short duration; such 
as, if they are not consumed by use, will decay and perish of 
themselves: gold, silver and diamonds, are things that fancy or 
agreement hath put the value on, more than real use, and the 
necessary support of life.  Now of those good things which nature 
hath provided in common, every one had a right (as hath been 
said) to as much as he could use, and property in all that he 
could effect with his labour; all that his industry could 
extend to, to alter from the state nature had put it in, was his.  
He that gathered a hundred bushels of acorns or apples, had 
thereby a property in them, they were his goods as soon as 
gathered.  He was only to look, that he used them before they 
spoiled, else he took more than his share, and robbed others.  
And indeed it was a foolish thing, as well as dishonest, to hoard 
up more than he could make use of.  If he gave away a part to any 
body else, so that it perished not uselesly in his possession, 
these he also made use of.  And if he also bartered away plums, 
that would have rotted in a week, for nuts that would last good 
for his eating a whole year, he did no injury; he wasted not the 
common stock; destroyed no part of the portion of goods that 
belonged to others, so long as nothing perished uselesly in his 
hands.  Again, if he would give his nuts for a piece of metal, 
pleased with its colour; or exchange his sheep for shells, or 
wool for a sparkling pebble or a diamond, and keep those by him 
all his life he invaded not the right of others, he might heap up 
as much of these durable things as he pleased; the exceeding of 
the bounds of his just property not lying in the largeness of 
his possession, but the perishing of any thing uselesly in it.
     Sec. 47.  And thus came in the use of money, some lasting 
thing that men might keep without spoiling, and that by mutual 
consent men would take in exchange for the truly useful, but 
perishable supports of life.
     Sec. 48.  And as different degrees of industry were apt to 
give men possessions in different proportions, so this invention 
of money gave them the opportunity to continue and enlarge them: 
for supposing an island, separate from all possible commerce with 
the rest of the world, wherein there were but an hundred 
families, but there were sheep, horses and cows, with other 
useful animals, wholsome fruits, and land enough for corn for a 
hundred thousand times as many, but nothing in the island, either 
because of its commonness, or perishableness, fit to supply the 
place of money; what reason could any one have there to enlarge 
his possessions beyond the use of his family, and a plentiful 
supply to its consumption, either in what their own industry 

produced, or they could barter for like perishable, useful 
commodities, with others?  Where there is not some thing, both 
lasting and scarce, and so valuable to be hoarded up, there men 
will not be apt to enlarge their possessions of land, were it 
never so rich, never so free for them to take: for I ask, what 
would a man value ten thousand, or an hundred thousand acres of 
excellent land, ready cultivated, and well stocked too with 
cattle, in the middle of the inland parts of America, where he 
had no hopes of commerce with other parts of the world, to draw 
money to him by the sale of the product?  It would not be worth 
the enclosing, and we should see him give up again to the wild 
common of nature, whatever was more than would supply the 
conveniencies of life to be had there for him and his family.
     Sec. 49.  Thus in the beginning all the world was America, 
and more so than that is now; for no such thing as money was 
any where known.  Find out something that hath the use and value 
of money amongst his neighbours, you shall see the same man will 
begin presently to enlarge his possessions.
     Sec. 50.  But since gold and silver, being little useful to 
the life of man in proportion to food, raiment, and carriage, has 
its value only from the consent of men, whereof labour yet 
makes, in great part, the measure, it is plain, that men have 
agreed to a disproportionate and unequal possession of the 
earth, they having, by a tacit and voluntary consent, found out, 
a way how a man may fairly possess more land than he himself can 
use the product of, by receiving in exchange for the overplus 
gold and silver, which may be hoarded up without injury to any 
one; these metals not spoiling or decaying in the hands of the 
possessor.  This partage of things in an inequality of private 
possessions, men have made practicable out of the bounds of 
society, and without compact, only by putting a value on gold and 
silver, and tacitly agreeing in the use of money: for in 
governments, the laws regulate the right of property, and the 
possession of land is determined by positive constitutions.
     Sec. 51.  And thus, I think, it is very easy to conceive, 
without any difficulty, how labour could at first begin a title 
of property in the common things of nature, and how the spending 
it upon our uses bounded it.  So that there could then be no 
reason of quarrelling about title, nor any doubt about the 
largeness of possession it gave.  Right and conveniency went 
together; for as a man had a right to all he could employ his 
labour upon, so he had no temptation to labour for more than he 
could make use of.  This left no room for controversy about the 
title, nor for encroachment on the right of others; what portion 
a man carved to himself, was easily seen; and it was useless, as 
well as dishonest, to carve himself too much, or take more than 
he needed.



                        CHAP.  VI.

                   Of Paternal Power.

     Sec. 52.  IT may perhaps be censured as an impertinent 
criticism, in a discourse of this nature, to find fault with 
words and names, that have obtained in the world: and yet 
possibly it may not be amiss to offer new ones, when the old are 
apt to lead men into mistakes, as this of paternal power 
probably has done, which seems so to place the power of parents 
over their children wholly in the father, as if the mother 
had no share in it; whereas, if we consult reason or revelation, 
we shall find, she hath an equal title.  This may give one reason 
to ask, whether this might not be more properly called parental 
power?  for whatever obligation nature and the right of 
generation lays on children, it must certainly bind them equal to 

both the concurrent causes of it.  And accordingly we see the 
positive law of God every where joins them together, without 
distinction, when it commands the obedience of children, Honour 
thy father and thy mother, Exod. xx. 12.  Whosoever curseth his 
father or his mother, Lev. xx. 9.  Ye shall fear every man his 
mother and his father, Lev. xix. 3.  Children, obey your 
parents, &c. Eph. vi. 1.  is the stile of the Old and New 
Testament.
     Sec. 53.  Had but this one thing been well considered, 
without looking any deeper into the matter, it might perhaps have 
kept men from running into those gross mistakes, they have made, 
about this power of parents; which, however it might, without any 
great harshness, bear the name of absolute dominion, and regal 
authority, when under the title of paternal power it seemed 
appropriated to the father, would yet have founded but oddly, and 
in the very name shewn the absurdity, if this supposed absolute 
power over children had been called parental; and thereby have 
discovered, that it belonged to the mother too: for it will but 
very ill serve the turn of those men, who contend so much for the 
absolute power and authority of the fatherhood, as they call 
it, that the mother should have any share in it; and it would 
have but ill supported the monarchy they contend for, when by 
the very name it appeared, that that fundamental authority, from 
whence they would derive their government of a single person 
only, was not placed in one, but two persons jointly.  But to let 
this of names pass.
     Sec. 54.  Though I have said above, Chap.  II. That all men 
by nature are equal, I cannot be supposed to understand all 
sorts of equality: age or virtue may give men a just 
precedency: excellency of parts and merit may place others 
above the common level: birth may subject some, and alliance 
or benefits others, to pay an observance to those to whom 
nature, gratitude, or other respects, may have made it due: and 
yet all this consists with the equality, which all men are in, 
in respect of jurisdiction or dominion one over another; which 
was the equality I there spoke of, as proper to the business in 
hand, being that equal right, that every man hath, to his 
natural freedom, without being subjected to the will or 
authority of any other man.
     Sec. 55.  Children, I confess, are not born in this full 
state of equality, though they are born to it.  Their parents 
have a sort of rule and jurisdiction over them, when they come 
into the world, and for some time after; but it is but a 
temporary one.  The bonds of this subjection are like the 
swaddling clothes they art wrapt up in, and supported by, in the 
weakness of their infancy: age and reason as they grow up, loosen 
them, till at length they drop quite off, and leave a man at his 
own free disposal.
     Sec. 56.  Adam was created a perfect man, his body and 
mind in full possession of their strength and reason, and so was 
capable, from the first instant of his being to provide for his 
own support and preservation, and govern his actions according to 
the dictates of the law of reason which God had implanted in him.  
From him the world is peopled with his descendants, who are all 
born infants, weak and helpless, without knowledge or 
understanding: but to supply the defects of this imperfect state, 
till the improvement of growth and age hath removed them, Adam 
and Eve, and after them all parents were, by the law of 
nature, under an obligation to preserve, nourish, and educate 
the children they had begotten; not as their own workmanship, 
but the workmanship of their own maker, the Almighty, to whom 
they were to be accountable for them.
     Sec. 57.  The law, that was to govern Adam, was the same 
that was to govern all his posterity, the law of reason.  But 
his offspring having another way of entrance into the world, 
different from him, by a natural birth, that produced them 

ignorant and without the use of reason, they were not presently 
under that law; for no body can be under a law, which is not 
promulgated to him; and this law being promulgated or made known 
by reason only, he that is not come to the use of his reason, 
cannot be said to be under this law; and Adam's children, 
being not presently as soon as born under this law of reason, 
were not presently free: for law, in its true notion, is 
not so much the limitation as the direction of a free and 
intelligent agent to his proper interest, and prescribes no 
farther than is for the general good of those under that law: 
could they be happier without it, the law, as an useless thing, 
would of itself vanish; and that ill deserves the name of 
confinement which hedges us in only from bogs and precipices.  So 
that, however it may be mistaken, the end of law is not to 
abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge freedom: for 
in all the states of created beings capable of laws, where there 
is no law, there is no freedom: for liberty is, to be free 
from restraint and violence from others; which cannot be, where 
there is no law: but freedom is not, as we are told, a liberty 
for every man to do what he lists: (for who could be free, when 
every other man's humour might domineer over him?) but a 
liberty to dispose, and order as he lists, his person, actions, 
possessions, and his whole property, within the allowance of 
those laws under which he is, and therein not to be subject to 
the arbitrary will of another, but freely follow his own.
     Sec. 58.  The power, then, that parents have over their 
children, arises from that duty which is incumbent on them, to 
take care of their off-spring, during the imperfect state of 
childhood.  To inform the mind, and govern the actions of their 
yet ignorant nonage, till reason shall take its place, and ease 
them of that trouble, is what the children want, and the parents 
are bound to: for God having given man an understanding to direct 
his actions, has allowed him a freedom of will, and liberty of 
acting, as properly belonging thereunto, within the bounds of 
that law he is under.  But whilst he is in an estate, wherein he 
has not understanding of his own to direct his will, he is 
not to have any will of his own to follow: he that 
understands for him, must will for him too; he must prescribe 
to his will, and regulate his actions; but when he comes to the 
estate that made his father a freeman, the son is a freeman 
too.
     Sec. 59.  This holds in all the laws a man is under, whether 
natural or civil.  Is a man under the law of nature?  What made 
him free of that law?  what gave him a free disposing of his 
property, according to his own will, within the compass of that 
law?  I answer, a state of maturity wherein he might be supposed 
capable to know that law, that so he might keep his actions 
within the bounds of it.  When he has acquired that state, he is 
presumed to know how far that law is to be his guide, and how far 
he may make use of his freedom, and so comes to have it; till 
then, some body else must guide him, who is presumed to know how 
far the law allows a liberty.  If such a state of reason, such an 
age of discretion made him free, the same shall make his son 
free too.  Is a man under the law of England?  What made him 
free of that law? that is, to have the liberty to dispose of his 
actions and possessions according to his own will, within the 
permission of that law?  A capacity of knowing that law; which is 
supposed by that law, at the age of one and twenty years, and in 
some cases sooner.  If this made the father free, it shall 
make the son free too.  Till then we see the law allows the 
son to have no will, but he is to be guided by the will of his 
father or guardian, who is to understand for him.  And if the 
father die, and fail to substitute a deputy in his trust; if he 
hath not provided a tutor, to govern his son, during his 
minority, during his want of understanding, the law takes care to 
do it; some other must govern him, and be a will to him, till he 

hath attained to a state of freedom, and his understanding be 
fit to take the government of his will.  But after that, the 
father and son are equally free as much as tutor and pupil 
after nonage; equally subjects of the same law together, without 
any dominion left in the father over the life, liberty, or estate 
of his son, whether they be only in the state and under the law 
of nature, or under the positive laws of an established 
government.
     Sec. 60.  But if, through defects that may happen out of the 
ordinary course of nature, any one comes not to such a degree of 
reason, wherein he might be supposed capable of knowing the law, 
and so living within the rules of it, he is never capable of 
being a free man, he is never let loose to the disposure of his 
own will (because he knows no bounds to it, has not 
understanding, its proper guide) but is continued under the 
tuition and government of others, all the time his own 
understanding is uncapable of that charge.  And so lunatics and 
ideots are never set free from the government of their parents; 
children, who are not as yet come unto those years whereat they 
may have; and innocents which are excluded by a natural defect 
from ever having; thirdly, madmen, which for the present cannot 
possibly have the use of right reason to guide themselves, have 
for their guide, the reason that guideth other men which are 
tutors over them, to seek and procure their good for them, says 
Hooker, Eccl. Pol. lib. i. sec. 7.  All which seems no more than 
that duty, which God and nature has laid on man, as well as other 
creatures, to preserve their offspring, till they can be able to 
shift for themselves, and will scarce amount to an instance or 
proof of parents regal authority.
     Sec. 61.  Thus we are born free, as we are born rational; 
not that we have actually the exercise of either: age, that 
brings one, brings with it the other too.  And thus we see how 
natural freedom and subjection to parents may consist together, 
and are both founded on the same principle.  A child is free 
by his father's title, by his father's understanding, which is to 
govern him till he hath it of his own.  The freedom of a man at 
years of discretion, and the subjection of a child to his 
parents, whilst yet short of that age, are so consistent, and 
so distinguishable, that the most blinded contenders for 
monarchy, by right of fatherhood, cannot miss this 
difference; the most obstinate cannot but allow their 
consistency: for were their doctrine all true, were the right 
heir of Adam now known, and by that title settled a monarch in 
his throne, invested with all the absolute unlimited power Sir 
Robert Filmer talks of; if he should die as soon as his heir 
were born, must not the child, notwithstanding he were never so 
free, never so much sovereign, be in subjection to his mother and 
nurse, to tutors and governors, till age and education brought 
him reason and ability to govern himself and others?  The 
necessities of his life, the health of his body, and the 
information of his mind, would require him to be directed by the 
will of others, and not his own; and yet will any one think, that 
this restraint and subjection were inconsistent with, or spoiled 
him of that liberty or sovereignty he had a right to, or gave 
away his empire to those who had the government of his nonage?  
This government over him only prepared him the better and sooner 
for it.  If any body should ask me, when my son is of age to be 
free?  I shall answer, just when his monarch is of age to 
govern.  But at what time, says the judicious Hooker, Eccl. 
Pol. l. i. sect. 6.  a man may be said to have attained so far 
forth the use of reason, as sufficeth to make him capable of 
those laws whereby he is then bound to guide his actions: this is 
a great deal more easy for sense to discern, than for any one by 
skill and learning to determine.
     Sec. 62.  Common-wealths themselves take notice of, and 
allow, that there is a time when men are to begin to act like 

free men, and therefore till that time require not oaths of 
fealty, or allegiance, or other public owning of, or submission 
to the government of their countries.
     Sec. 63.  The freedom then of man, and liberty of acting 
according to his own will, is grounded on his having reason, 
which is able to instruct him in that law he is to govern himself 
by, and make him know how far he is left to the freedom of his 
own will.  To turn him loose to an unrestrained liberty, before 
he has reason to guide him, is not the allowing him the privilege 
of his nature to be free; but to thrust him out amongst brutes, 
and abandon him to a state as wretched, and as much beneath that 
of a man, as their's.  This is that which puts the authority 
into the parents hands to govern the minority of their 
children.  God hath made it their business to employ this care on 
their offspring, and hath placed in them suitable inclinations of 
tenderness and concern to temper this power, to apply it, as his 
wisdom designed it, to the children's good, as long as they 
should need to be under it.
     Sec. 64.  But what reason can hence advance this care of the 
parents due to their off-spring into an absolute arbitrary 
dominion of the father, whose power reaches no farther, than by 
such a discipline, as he finds most effectual, to give such 
strength and health to their bodies, such vigour and rectitude to 
their minds, as may best fit his children to be most useful to 
themselves and others; and, if it be necessary to his condition, 
to make them work, when they are able, for their own subsistence.  
But in this power the mother too has her share with the 
father.
     Sec. 65.  Nay, this power so little belongs to the 
father by any peculiar right of nature, but only as he is 
guardian of his children, that when he quits his care of them, he 
loses his power over them, which goes along with their 
nourishment and education, to which it is inseparably annexed; 
and it belongs as much to the foster-father of an exposed 
child, as to the natural father of another.  So little power does 
the bare act of begetting give a man over his issue; if all his 
care ends there, and this be all the title he hath to the name 
and authority of a father.  And what will become of this 
paternal power in that part of the world, where one woman hath 
more than one husband at a time? or in those parts of America, 
where, when the husband and wife part, which happens frequently, 
the children are all left to the mother, follow her, and are 
wholly under her care and provision? If the father die whilst the 
children are young, do they not naturally every where owe the 
same obedience to their mother, during their minority, as to 
their father were he alive? and will any one say, that the mother 
hath a legislative power over her children? that she can make 
standing rules, which shall be of perpetual obligation, by which 
they ought to regulate all the concerns of their property, and 
bound their liberty all the course of their lives? or can she 
inforce the observation of them with capital punishments? for 
this is the proper power of the magistrate, of which the father 
hath not so much as the shadow.  His command over his children is 
but temporary, and reaches not their life or property: it is but 
a help to the weakness and imperfection of their nonage, a 
discipline necessary to their education: and though a father 
may dispose of his own possessions as he pleases, when his 
children are out of danger of perishing for want, yet his power 
extends not to the lives or goods, which either their own 
industry, or another's bounty has made their's; nor to their 
liberty neither, when they are once arrived to the 
infranchisement of the years of discretion.  The father's 
empire then ceases, and he can from thence forwards no more 
dispose of the liberty of his son, than that of any other man: 
and it must be far from an absolute or perpetual jurisdiction, 
from which a man may withdraw himself, having license from divine 

authority to leave father and mother, and cleave to his wife. 
     Sec. 66.  But though there be a time when a child comes to 
be as free from subjection to the will and command of his 
father, as the father himself is free from subjection to the will 
of any body else, and they are each under no other restraint, but 
that which is common to them both, whether it be the law of 
nature, or municipal law of their country; yet this freedom 
exempts not a son from that honour which he ought, by the law 
of God and nature, to pay his parents.  God having made the 
parents instruments in his great design of continuing the race of 
mankind, and the occasions of life to their children; as he hath 
laid on them an obligation to nourish, preserve, and bring up 
their offspring; so he has laid on the children a perpetual 
obligation of honouring their parents, which containing in it 
an inward esteem and reverence to be shewn by all outward 
expressions, ties up the child from any thing that may ever 
injure or affront, disturb or endanger, the happiness or life of 
those from whom he received his; and engages him in all actions 
of defence, relief, assistance and comfort of those, by whose 
means he entered into being, and has been made capable of any 
enjoyments of life: from this obligation no state, no freedom can 
absolve children.  But this is very far from giving parents a 
power of command over their children, or an authority to make 
laws and dispose as they please of their lives or liberties.  It 
is one thing to owe honour, respect, gratitude and assistance; 
another to require an absolute obedience and submission.  The 
honour due to parents, a monarch in his throne owes his mother; 
and yet this lessens not his authority, nor subjects him to her 
government.
     Sec. 67.  The subjection of a minor places in the father a 
temporary government, which terminates with the minority of the 
child: and the honour due from a child, places in the parents a 
perpetual right to respect, reverence, support and compliance 
too, more or less, as the father's care, cost, and kindness in 
his education, has been more or less.  This ends not with 
minority, but holds in all parts and conditions of a man's life.  
The want of distinguishing these two powers, viz. that which 
the father hath in the right of tuition, during minority, and 
the right of honour all his life, may perhaps have caused a 
great part of the mistakes about this matter: for to speak 
properly of them, the first of these is rather the privilege of 
children, and duty of parents, than any prerogative of paternal 
power.  The nourishment and education of their children is a 
charge so incumbent on parents for their children's good, that 
nothing can absolve them from taking care of it: and though the 
power of commanding and chastising them go along with it, yet 
God hath woven into the principles of human nature such a 
tenderness for their off-spring, that there is little fear that 
parents should use their power with too much rigour; the excess 
is seldom on the severe side, the strong byass of nature drawing 
the other way.  And therefore God almighty when he would express 
his gentle dealing with the Israelites, he tells them, that 
though he chastened them, he chastened them as a man chastens 
his son, Deut. viii. 5. i.e. with tenderness and affection, 
and kept them under no severer discipline than what was 
absolutely best for them, and had been less kindness to have 
slackened.  This is that power to which children are commanded 
obedience, that the pains and care of their parents may not be 
increased, or ill rewarded.
     Sec. 68.  On the other side, honour and support, all 
that which gratitude requires to return for the benefits received 
by and from them, is the indispensable duty of the child, and the 
proper privilege of the parents.  This is intended for the 
parents advantage, as the other is for the child's; though 
education, the parents duty, seems to have most power, because 
the ignorance and infirmities of childhood stand in need of 

restraint and correction; which is a visible exercise of rule, 
and a kind of dominion.  And that duty which is comprehended in 
the word honour, requires less obedience, though the obligation 
be stronger on grown, than younger children: for who can think 
the command, Children obey your parents, requires in a man, 
that has children of his own, the same submission to his father, 
as it does in his yet young children to him; and that by this 
precept he were bound to obey all his father's commands, if, out 
of a conceit of authority, he should have the indiscretion to 
treat him still as a boy?
     Sec. 69.  The first part then of paternal power, or rather 
duty, which is education, belongs so to the father, that it 
terminates at a certain season; when the business of education is 
over, it ceases of itself, and is also alienable before: for a 
man may put the tuition of his son in other hands; and he that 
has made his son an apprentice to another, has discharged him, 
during that time, of a great part of his obedience both to 
himself and to his mother.  But all the duty of honour, the 
other part, remains never the less entire to them; nothing can 
cancel that: it is so inseparable from them both, that the 
father's authority cannot dispossess the mother of this right, 
nor can any man discharge his son from honouring her that bore 
him.  But both these are very far from a power to make laws, and 
enforcing them with penalties, that may reach estate, liberty, 
limbs and life.  The power of commanding ends with nonage; and 
though, after that, honour and respect, support and defence, 
and whatsoever gratitude can oblige a man to, for the highest 
benefits he is naturally capable of, be always due from a son to 
his parents; yet all this puts no scepter into the father's hand, 
no sovereign power of commanding.  He has no dominion over his 
son's property, or actions; nor any right, that his will should 
prescribe to his son's in all things; however it may become his 
son in many things, not very inconvenient to him and his family, 
to pay a deference to it.
     Sec. 70.  A man may owe honour and respect to an ancient, or 
wise man; defence to his child or friend; relief and support to 
the distressed; and gratitude to a benefactor, to such a degree, 
that all he has, all he can do, cannot sufficiently pay it: but 
all these give no authority, no right to any one, of making laws 
over him from whom they are owing.  And it is plain, all this is 
due not only to the bare title of father; not only because, as 
has been said, it is owing to the mother too; but because these 
obligations to parents, and the degrees of what is required of 
children, may be varied by the different care and kindness, 
trouble and expence, which is often employed upon one child more 
than another.
     Sec. 71.  This shews the reason how it comes to pass, that 
parents in societies, where they themselves are subjects, retain 
a power over their children, and have as much right to their 
subjection, as those who are in the state of nature.  Which could 
not possibly be, if all political power were only paternal, and 
that in truth they were one and the same thing: for then, all 
paternal power being in the prince, the subject could naturally 
have none of it.  But these two powers, political and paternal, 
are so perfectly distinct and separate; are built upon so 
different foundations, and given to so different ends, that every 
subject that is a father, has as much a paternal power over his 
children, as the prince has over his: and every prince, that has 
parents, owes them as much filial duty and obedience, as the 
meanest of his subjects do to their's; and can therefore contain 
not any part or degree of that kind of dominion, which a prince 
or magistrate has over his subject.  
     Sec. 72.  Though the obligation on the parents to bring up 
their children, and the obligation on children to honour their 
parents, contain all the power on the one hand, and submission on 
the other, which are proper to this relation, yet there is 

another power ordinarily in the father, whereby he has a tie on 
the obedience of his children; which tho' it be common to him 
with other men, yet the occasions of shewing it, almost consich 
tho' it be common to him with other men, yet the occasions of 
shewing it, almost constantly happening to fathers in their 
private families, and the instances of it elsewhere being rare, 
and less taken notice of, it passes in the world for a part of 
paternal jurisdiction.  And this is the power men generally have 
to bestow their estates on those who please them best; the 
possession of the father being the expectation and inheritance of 
the children, ordinarily in certain proportions, according to the 
law and custom of each country; yet it is commonly in the 
father's power to bestow it with a more sparing or liberal hand, 
according as the behaviour of this or that child hath comported 
with his will and humour.
     Sec. 73.  This is no small tie on the obedience of children: 
and there being always annexed to the enjoyment of land, a 
submission to the government of the country, of which that land 
is a part; it has been commonly supposed, that a father could 
oblige his posterity to that government, of which he himself was 
a subject, and that his compact held them; whereas, it being only 
a necessary condition annexed to the land, and the inheritance of 
an estate which is under that government, reaches only those who 
will take it on that condition, and so is no natural tie or 
engagement, but a voluntary submission: for every man's children 
being by nature as free as himself, or any of his ancestors ever 
were, may, whilst they are in that freedom, choose what society 
they will join themselves to, what common-wealth they will put 
themselves under.  But if they will enjoy the inheritance of 
their ancestors, they must take it on the same terms their 
ancestors had it, and submit to all the conditions annexed to 
such a possession.  By this power indeed fathers oblige their 
children to obedience to themselves, even when they are past 
minority, and most commonly too subject them to this or that 
political power: but neither of these by any peculiar right of 
fatherhood, but by the reward they have in their hands to inforce 
and recompence such a compliance; and is no more power than what 
a French man has over an English man, who by the hopes of an 
estate he will leave him, will certainly have a strong tie on his 
obedience: and if, when it is left him, he will enjoy it, he must 
certainly take it upon the conditions annexed to the possession 
of land in that country where it lies, whether it be France or 
England. 
     Sec. 74.  To conclude then, tho' the father's power of 
commanding extends no farther than the minority of his children, 
and to a degree only fit for the discipline and government of 
that age; and tho' that honour and respect, and all that which 
the Latins called piety, which they indispensably owe to their 
parents all their life-time, and in all estates, with all that 
support and defence is due to them, gives the father no power of 
governing, i.e.  making laws and enacting penalties on his 
children; though by all this he has no dominion over the property 
or actions of his son: yet it is obvious to conceive how easy it 
was, in the first ages of the world, and in places still, where 
the thinness of people gives families leave to separate into 
unpossessed quarters, and they have room to remove or plant 
themselves in yet vacant habitations, for the father of the 
family to become the prince of* it; he had been a ruler from the 
beginning of the infancy of his children: and since without some 
government it would be hard for them to live together, it was 
likeliest it should, by the express or tacit consent of the 
children when they were grown up, be in the father, where it 
seemed without any change barely to continue; when indeed nothing 
more was required to it, than the permitting the father to 
exercise alone, in his family, that executive power of the law of 
nature, which every free man naturally hath, and by that 

permission resigning up to him a monarchical power, whilst they 
remained in it.  But that this was not by any paternal right, but 
only by the consent of his children, is evident from hence, that 
no body doubts, but if a stranger, whom chance or business had 
brought to his family, had there killed any of his children, or 
committed any other fact, he might condemn and put him to death, 
or other-wise have punished him, as well as any of his children; 
which it was impossible he should do by virtue of any paternal 
authority over one who was not his child, but by virtue of that 
executive power of the law of nature, which, as a man, he had a 
right to: and he alone could punish him in his family, where the 
respect of his children had laid by the exercise of such a power, 
to give way to the dignity and authority they were willing should 
remain in him, above the rest of his family.  
     (*It is no improbable opinion therefore, which the 
archphilosopher was of, that the chief person in every houshold 
was always, as it were, a king: so when numbers of housholds 
joined themselves in civil societies together, kings were the 
first kind of governors amongst them, which is also, as it 
seemeth, the reason why the name of fathers continued still in 
them, who, of fathers, were made rulers; as also the ancient 
custom of governors to do as Melchizedec, and being kings, to 
exercise the office of priests, which fathers did at the first, 
grew perhaps by the same occasion.  Howbeit, this is not the only 
kind of regiment that has been received in the world.  The 
inconveniences of one kind have caused sundry others to be 
devised; so that in a word, all public regiment, of what kind 
soever, seemeth evidently to have risen from the deliberate 
advice, consultation and composition between men, judging it 
convenient and behoveful; there being no impossibility in nature 
considered by itself, but that man might have lived without any 
public regiment, Hooker's Eccl. Pol. lib. i. sect. 10.)
     Sec. 75.  Thus it was easy, and almost natural for children, 
by a tacit, and scarce avoidable consent, to make way for the 
father's authority and government.  They had been  accustomed  in  
their childhood to follow his direction, and to refer their 
little differences to him, and when they were men, who fitter to 
rule them?  Their little properties, and less covetousness, 
seldom afforded greater controversies; and when any should arise, 
where could they have a fitter umpire than he, by whose care they 
had every one been sustained and brought up, and who had a 
tenderness for them aII?  It is no wonder that they made no 
distinction betwixt minority and full age; nor looked after one 
and twenty, or any other age that might make them the free 
disposers of themselves and fortunes, when they could have no 
desire to be out of their pupilage: the government they had been 
under, during it, continued still to be more their protection 
than restraint; and they could no where find a greater security 
to their peace, liberties, and fortunes, than in the rule of a 
father.  
     Sec. 76.  Thus the natural fathers of families, by an 
insensible change, became the politic monarchs of them too: and 
as they chanced to live long, and leave able and worthy heirs, 
for several successions, or otherwise; so they laid the 
foundations of hereditary, or elective kingdoms, under several 
constitutions and mannors, according as chance, contrivance, or 
occasions happened to mould them.  But if princes have their 
titles in their fathers right, and it be a sufficient proof of 
the natural right of fathers to political authority, because they 
commonly were those in whose hands we find, de facto, the 
exercise of government: I say, if this argument be good, it will 
as strongly prove, that all princes, nay princes only, ought to 
be priests, since it is as certain, that in the beginning, the 
father of the family was priest, as that he was ruler in his own 
houshold.




                        CHAP.  VII.

             Of Political or Civil Society.

     Sec. 77.  GOD having made man such a creature, that in his 
own judgment, it was not good for him to be alone, put him under 
strong obligations of necessity, convenience, and inclination to 
drive him into society, as well as fitted him with understanding 
and language to continue and enjoy it.  The first society was 
between man and wife, which gave beginning to that between 
parents and children; to which, in time, that between master and 
servant came to be added: and though all these might, and 
commonly did meet together, and make up but one family, wherein 
the master or mistress of it had some sort of rule proper to a 
family; each of these, or all together, came short of political 
society, as we shall see, if we consider the different ends, 
ties, and bounds of each of these.
     Sec. 78.  Conjugal society is made by a voluntary compact 
between man and woman; and tho' it consist chiefly in such a 
communion and right in one another's bodies as is necessary to 
its chief end, procreation; yet it draws with it mutual support 
and assistance, and a communion of interests too, as necessary 
not only to unite their care and affection, but also necessary to 
their common off-spring, who have a right to be nourished, and 
maintained by them, till they are able to provide for themselves.
     Sec. 79.  For the end of conjunction, between male and 
female, being not barely procreation, but the continuation of the 
species; this conjunction betwixt male and female ought to last, 
even after procreation, so long as is necessary to the 
nourishment and support of the young ones, who are to be 
sustained 
even after procreation, so long as is necessary to the 
nourishment and support of the young ones, who are to be 
sustained by those that got them, till they are able to shift and 
provide for themselves.  This rule, which the infinite wise maker 
hath set to the works of his hands, we find the inferior 
creatures steadily obey.  In those viviparous animals which feed 
on grass, the conjunction between male and female lasts no longer 
than the very act of copulation; because the teat of the dam 
being sufficient to nourish the young, till it be able to feed on 
grass, the male only begets, but concerns not himself for the 
female or young, to whose sustenance he can contribute nothing.  
But in beasts of prey the conjunction lasts longer: because the 
dam not being able well to subsist herself, and nourish her 
numerous off-spring by her own prey alone, a more laborious, as 
well as more dangerous way of living, than by feeding on grass, 
the assistance of the male is necessary to the maintenance of 
their common family, which cannot subsist till they are able to 
prey for themselves, but by the joint care of male and female.  
The same is to be observed in all birds, (except some domestic 
ones, where plenty of food excuses the cock from feeding, and 
taking care of the young brood) whose young needing food in the 
nest, the cock and hen continue mates, till the young are able to 
use their wing, and provide for themselves.
     Sec. 80.  And herein I think lies the chief, if not the only 
reason, why the male and female in mankind are tied to a longer 
conjunction than other creatures, viz.  because the female is 
capable of conceiving, and de facto is commonly with child again, 
and brings forth too a new birth, long before the former is out 
of a dependency for support on his parents help, and able to 
shift for himself, and has all the assistance is due to him from 
his parents: whereby the father, who is bound to take care for 
those he hath begot, is under an obligation to continue in 
conjugal society with the same woman longer than other creatures, 

whose young being able to subsist of themselves, before the time 
of procreation returns again, the conjugal bond dissolves of 
itself, and they are at liberty, till Hymen at his usual 
anniversary season summons them again to chuse new mates.  
Wherein one cannot but admire the wisdom of the great Creator, 
who having given to man foresight, and an ability to lay up for 
the future, as well as to supply the present necessity, hath made 
it necessary, that society of man and wife should be more 
lasting, than of male and female amongst other creatures; that so 
their industry might be encouraged, and their interest better 
united, to make provision and lay up goods for their common 
issue, which uncertain mixture, or easy and frequent solutions of 
conjugal society would mightily disturb.
     Sec. 81.  But tho'these are ties upon mankind, which make 
the conjugal bonds more firm and lasting in man, than the other 
species of animals; yet it would give one reason to enquire, why 
this compact, where procreation and education are secured, and 
inheritance taken care for, may not be made determinable, either 
by consent, or at a certain time, or upon certain conditions, as 
well as any other voluntary compacts, there being no necessity in 
the nature of the thing, nor to the ends of it, that it should 
always be for life; I mean, to such as are under no restraint of 
any positive law, which ordains all such contracts to be 
perpetual.
     Sec. 82.  But the husband and wife, though they have but one 
common concern, yet having different understandings, will 
unavoidably sometimes have different wills too; it therefore 
being necessary that the last determination, i. e.  the rule, 
should be placed somewhere; it naturally falls to the man's 
share, as the abler and the stronger.  But this reaching but to 
the things of their common interest and property, leaves the wife 
in the full and free possession of what by contract is her 
peculiar right, and gives the husband no more power over her life 
than she has over his; the power of the husband being so far from 
that of an absolute monarch, that the wife has in many cases a 
liberty to separate from him, where natural right, or their 
contract allows it; whether that contract be made by themselves 
in the state of nature, or by the customs or laws of the country 
they live in; and the children upon such separation fall to the 
father or mother's lot, as such contract does determine.
     Sec. 83.  For all the ends of marriage being to be obtained 
under politic government, as well as in the state of nature, the 
civil magistrate cloth not abridge the right or power of either 
naturally necessary to those ends, viz.  procreation and mutual 
support and assistance whilst they are together; but only decides 
any controversy that may arise between man and wife about them.  
If it were otherwise, and that absolute sovereignty and power of 
life and death naturally belonged to the husband, and were 
necessary to the society between man and wife, there could be no 
matrimony in any of those countries where the husband is allowed 
no such absolute authority.  But the ends of matrimony requiring 
no such power in the husband, the condition of conjugal society 
put it not in him, it being not at all necessary to that state.  
Conjugal society could subsist and attain its ends without it; 
nay, community of goods, and the power over them, mutual 
assistance and maintenance, and other things belonging to 
conjugal society, might be varied and regulated by that contract 
which unites man and wife in that society, as far as may consist 
with procreation and the bringing up of children till they could 
shift for themselves; nothing being necessary to any society, 
that is not necessary to the ends for which it is made.
     Sec. 84.  The society betwixt parents and children, and the 
distinct rights and powers belonging respectively to them, I have 
treated of so largely, in the foregoing chapter, that I shall not 
here need to say any thing of it.  And I think it is plain, that 
it is far different from a politic society.

     Sec. 85.  Master and servant are names as old as history, 
but given to those of far different condition; for a freeman 
makes himself a servant to another, by selling him, for a certain 
time, the service he undertakes to do, in exchange for wages he 
is to receive: and though this commonly puts him into the family 
of his master, and under the ordinary discipline thereof; yet it 
gives the master but a temporary power over him, and no greater 
than what is contained in the contract between them.  But there 
is another sort of servants, which by a peculiar name we call 
slaves, who being captives taken in a just war, are by the right 
of nature subjected to the absolute dominion and arbitrary power 
of their masters.  These men having, as I say, forfeited their 
lives, and with it their liberties, and lost their estates; and 
being in the state of slavery, not capable of any property, 
cannot in that state be considered as any part of civil society; 
the chief end whereof is the preservation of property.
     Sec. 86.  Let us therefore consider a master of a family 
with all these subordinate relations of wife, children, servants, 
and slaves, united under the domestic rule of a family; which, 
what resemblance soever it may have in its order, offices, and 
number too, with a little common-wealth, yet is very far from it, 
both in its constitution, power and end: or if it must be thought 
a monarchy, and the paterfamilias the absolute monarch in it, 
absolute monarchy will have but a very shattered and short power, 
when it is plain, by what has been said before, that the master 
of the family has a very distinct and differently limited power, 
both as to time and extent, over those several persons that are 
in it; for excepting the slave (and the family is as much a 
family, and his power as paterfamilias as great, whether there be 
any slaves in his family or no) he has no legislative power of 
life and death over any of them, and none too but what a mistress 
of a family may have as well as he.  And he certainly can have no 
absolute power over the whole family, who has but a very limited 
one over every individual in it.  But how a family, or any other 
society of men, differ from that which is properly political 
society, we shall best see, by considering wherein political 
society itself consists.
     Sec. 87.  Man being born, as has been proved, with a title 
to perfect freedom, and an uncontrouled enjoyment of all the 
rights and privileges of the law of nature, equally with any 
other man, or number of men in the world, hath by nature a power, 
not only to preserve his property, that is, his life, liberty and 
estate, against the injuries and attempts of other men; but to 
judge of, and punish the breaches of that law in others, as he is 
persuaded the offence deserves, even with death itself, in crimes 
where the heinousness of the fact, in his opinion, requires it.  
But because no political society can be, nor subsist, without 
having in itself the power to preserve the property, and in order 
thereunto, punish the offences of all those of that society; 
there, and there only is political society, where every one of 
the members hath quitted this natural power, resigned it up into 
the hands of the community in all cases that exclude him not from 
appealing for protection to the law established by it.  And thus 
all private judgment of every particular member being excluded, 
the community comes to be umpire, by settled standing rules, 
indifferent, and the same to all parties; and by men having 
authority from the community, for the execution of those rules, 
decides all the differences that may happen between any members 
of that society concerning any matter of right; and punishes 
those offences which any member hath committed against the 
society, with such penalties as the law has established: whereby 
it is easy to discern, who are, and who are not, in political 
society together.  Those who are united into one body, and have a 
common established law and judicature to appeal to, with 
authority to decide controversies between them, and punish 
offenders, are in civil society one with another: but those who 

have no such common appeal, I mean on earth, are still in the 
state of nature, each being, where there is no other, judge for 
himself, and executioner; which is, as I have before shewed it, 
the perfect state of nature.  
     Sec. 88.  And thus the common-wealth comes by a power to set 
down what punishment shall belong to the several transgressions 
which they think worthy of it, committed amongst the members of 
that society, (which is the power of making laws) as well as it 
has the power to punish any injury done unto any of its members, 
by any one that is not of it, (which is the power of war and 
peace;) and all this for the preservation of the property of all 
the members of that society, as far as is possible.  But though 
every man who has entered into civil society, and is become a 
member of any commonwealth, has thereby quitted his power to 
punish offences, against the law of nature, in prosecution of his 
own private judgment, yet with the judgment of offences, which he 
has given up to the legislative in all cases, where he can appeal 
to the magistrate, he has given a right to the common-wealth to 
employ his force, for the execution of the judgments of the 
common-wealth, whenever he shall be called to it; which indeed 
are his own judgments, they being made by himself, or his 
representative.  And herein we have the original of the 
legislative and executive power of civil society, which is to 
judge by standing laws, how far offences are to be punished, when 
committed within the common-wealth; and also to determine, by 
occasional judgments founded on the present circumstances of the 
fact, how far injuries from without are to be vindicated; and in 
both these to employ all the force of all the members, when there 
shall be need.  
     Sec. 89.  Where-ever therefore any number of men are so 
united into one society, as to quit every one his executive power 
of the law of nature, and to resign it to the public, there and 
there only is a political, or civil society.  And this is done, 
where-ever any number of men, in the state of nature, enter into 
society to make one people, one body politic, under one supreme 
government; or else when any one joins himself to, and 
incorporates with any government already made: for hereby he 
authorizes the society, or which is all one, the legislative 
thereof, to make laws for him, as the public good of the society 
shall require; to the execution whereof, his own assistance (as 
to his own decrees) is due.  And this puts men out of a state of 
nature into that of a common-wealth, by setting up a judge on 
earth, with authority to determine all the controversies, and 
redress the injuries that may happen to any member of the 
commonwealth; which judge is the legislative, or magistrates 
appointed by it.  And where-ever there are any number  of  men,  
however associated, that have no such decisive power to appeal 
to, there they are still in the state of nature.  
     Sec. 90.  Hence it is evident, that absolute monarchy, which 
by some men is counted the only government in the world, is 
indeed inconsistent with civil society, and so can be no form of 
civil-government at all: for the end of civil society, being to 
avoid, and remedy those inconveniencies of the state of nature, 
which necessarily follow from every man's being judge in his own 
case, by setting up a known authority, to which every one of that 
society may appeal upon any injury received, or controversy that 
may arise, and which every one of the* society ought to obey; 
where-ever any persons are, who have not such an authority to 
appeal to, for the decision of any difference between them, there 
those persons are still in the state of nature; and so is every 
absolute prince, in respect of those who are under his dominion.  
     (*The public power of all society is above every soul 
contained in the same society; and the principal use of that 
power is, to give laws unto all that are under it, which laws in 
such cases we must obey, unless there be reason shewed which may 
necessarily inforce, that the law of reason, or of God, doth 

enjoin the contrary, Hook. Eccl. Pol. l. i. sect. 16.)  
     Sec. 91.  For he being supposed to have all, both 
legislative and executive power in himself alone, there is no 
judge to be found, no appeal lies open to any one, who may 
fairly, and indifferently, and with authority decide, and from 
whose decision relief and redress may be expected of any injury 
or inconviency, that may be suffered from the prince, or by his 
order: so that such a man, however intitled, Czar, or Grand 
Seignior, or how you please, is as much in the state of nature, 
with all under his dominion, as he is with therest of mankind: 
for where-ever any two men are, who have no standing rule, and 
common judge to appeal to on earth, for the determination of 
controversies of right betwixt them, there they are still in the 
state of* nature, and under all the inconveniencies of it, with 
only this woful difference to the subject, or rather slave of an 
absolute prince: that whereas, in the ordinary state of nature, 
he has a liberty to judge of his right, and according to the best 
of his power, to maintain it; now, whenever his property is 
invaded by the will and order of his monarch, he has not only no 
appeal, as those in society ought to have, but as if he were 
degraded from the common state of rational creatures, is denied a 
liberty to judge of, or to defend his right; and so is exposed to 
all the misery and inconveniencies, that a man can fear from one, 
who being in the unrestrained state of nature, is yet corrupted 
with flattery, and armed with power.  
     (*To take away all such mutual grievances, injuries and 
wrongs, i.e. such as attend men in the state of nature, there was 
no way but only by growing into composition and agreement amongst 
themselves, by ordaining some kind of govemment public, and by 
yielding themselves subject thereunto, that unto whom they 
granted authority to rule and govem, by them the peace, 
tranquillity and happy estate of the rest might be procured.  Men 
always knew that where force and injury was offered, they might 
be defenders of themselves; they knew that however men may seek 
their own commodity, yet if this were done with injury unto 
others, it was not to be suffered, but by all men, and all good 
means to be withstood.  Finally, they knew that no man might in 
reason take upon him to determine his own right, and according to 
his own determination proceed in maintenance thereof, in as much 
as every man is towards himself, and them whom he greatly 
affects, partial; and therefore that strifes and troubles would 
be endless, except they gave their common consent, all to be 
ordered by some, whom they should agree upon, without which 
consent there would be no reason that one man should take upon 
him to be lord or judge over another, Hooker's Eccl. Pol. l. i. 
sect. 10.)  
     Sec. 92.  For he that thinks absolute power purifies men's 
blood, and corrects the baseness of human nature, need read but 
the history of this, or any other age, to be convinced of the 
contrary.  He that would have been insolent and injurious in the 
woods of America, would not probably be much better in a throne; 
where perhaps learning and religion shall be found out to justify 
all that he shall do to his subjects, and the sword presently 
silence all those that dare question it: for what the protection 
of absolute monarchy is, what kind of fathers of their countries 
it makes princes to be and to what a degree of happiness and 
security it carries civil society, where this sort of government 
is grown to perfection, he that will look into the late relation 
of Ceylon, may easily see.  
     Sec. 93.  In absolute monarchies indeed, as well as other 
governments of the world, the subjects have an appeal to the law, 
and judges to decide any controversies, and restrain any violence 
that may happen betwixt the subjects themselves, one amongst 
another.  This every one thinks necessary, and believes he 
deserves to be thought a declared enemy to society and mankind, 
who should go about to take it away.  But whether this be from a 

true love of mankind and society, and such a charity as we owe 
all one to another, there is reason to doubt: for this is no more 
than what every man, who loves his own power, profit, or 
greatness, may and naturally must do, keep those animals from 
hurting, or destroying one another, who labour and drudge only 
for his pleasure and advantage; and so are taken care of, not out 
of any love the master has for them, but love of himself, and the 
profit they bring him: for if it be asked, what security, what 
fence is there, in such a state, against the violence and 
oppression of this absolute ruler? the very question can scarce 
be borne.  They are ready to tell you, that it deserves death 
only to ask after safety.  Betwixt subject and subject, they will 
grant, there must be measures, laws and judges, for their mutual 
peace and security: but as for the ruler, he ought to be 
absolute, and is above all such circumstances; because he has 
power to do more hurt and wrong, it is right when he does it.  To 
ask how you may be guarded from harm, or injury, on that side 
where the strongest hand is to do it, is presently the voice of 
faction and rebellion: as if when men quitting the state of 
nature entered into society, they agreed that all of them but 
one, should be under the restraint of laws, but that he should 
still retain all the liberty of the state of nature, increased 
with power, and made licentious by impunity.  This is to think, 
that men are so foolish, that they take care to avoid what 
mischiefs may be done them by pole-cats, or foxes; but are 
content, nay, think it safety, to be devoured by lions.  
     Sec. 94.  But whatever flatterers may talk to amuse people's 
understandings, it hinders not men from feeling; and when they 
perceive, that any man, in what station soever, is out of the 
bounds of the civil society which they are of, and that they have 
no appeal on earth against any harm, they may receive from him, 
they are apt to think themselves in the state of nature, in 
respect of him whom they find to be so; and to take care, as soon 
as they can, to have that safety and security in civil society, 
for which it was first instituted, and for which only they 
entered into it.  And therefore, though perhaps at first , (as 
shall be shewed more at large hereafter in the following part of 
this discourse) some one good and excellent man having got a 
pre -eminency amongst the rest, had this deference paid to his 
goodness and virtue, as to a kind of natural authority, that the 
chief rule, with arbitration of their differences, by a tacit 
consent devolved into his hands, without any other caution, but 
the assurance they had of his uprightness and wisdom; yet when 
time, giving authority, and (as some men would persuade us) 
sacredness of customs, which the negligent, and unforeseeing 
innocence of the first ages began, had brought in successors of 
another stamp, the people finding their properties not secure 
under the government, as then it was, (whereas government has no 
other end but the preservation of * property) could never be safe 
nor at rest, nor think themselves in civil society, till the 
legislature was placed in collective bodies of men, call them 
senate, parliament, or what you please.  By which means every 
single person became subject, equally with other the meanest men, 
to those laws, which he himself, as part of the legislative, had 
established; nor could any one, by his own authority; avoid the 
force of the law, when once made; nor by any pretence of 
superiority plead exemption, thereby to license his own, or the 
miscarriages of any of his dependents.**  No man in civil society 
can be exempted from the laws of it: for if any man may do what 
he thinks fit, and there be no appeal on earth, for redress or 
security against any harm he shall do; I ask, whether he be not 
perfectly still in the state of nature, and so can be no part or 
member of that civil society; unless any one will say, the state 
of nature and civil society are one and the same thing, which I 
have never yet found any one so great a patron of anarchy as to 
affirm.  

     (*At the first, when some certain kind of regiment was once 
appointed, it may be that nothing was then farther thought upon 
for the manner of goveming, but all permitted unto their wisdom 
and discretion, which were to rule, till by experience they found 
this for all parts very inconvenient, so as the thing which they 
had devised for a remedy, did indeed but increase the sore, which 
it should have cured.  They saw, that to live by one man's will, 
became the cause of all men's misery.  This constrained them to 
come unto laws, wherein all men might see their duty beforehand, 
and know the penalties of transgressing them.  Hooker's Eccl. 
Pol. l. i. sect. 10.)

therefore over-rule each several part of the same body.  Hooker, 
ibid.)  

 

                     CHAP.  VIII.

        Of the Beginning of Political Societies.

     Sec. 95.  MEN being, as has been said, by nature, all free, 
equal, and independent, no one can be put out of this estate, and 
subjected to the political power of another, without his own 
consent.  The only way whereby any one divests himself of his 
natural liberty, and puts on the bonds of civil society, is by 
agreeing with other men to join and unite into a community for 
their comfortable, safe, and peaceable living one amongst 
another, in a secure enjoyment of their properties, and a greater 
security against any, that are not of it.  This any number of men 
may do, because it injures not the freedom of the rest; they are 
left as they were in the liberty of the state of nature.  When 
any number of men have so consented to make one community or 
government, they are thereby presently incorporated, and make one 
body politic, wherein the majority have a right to act and 
conclude the rest.
     Sec. 96.  For when any number of men have, by the consent of 
every individual, made a community, they have thereby made that 
community one body, with a power to act as one body, which is 
only by the will and determination of the majority: for that 
which acts any community, being only the consent of the 
individuals of it, and it being necessary to that which is one 
body to move one way; it is necessary the body should move that 
way whither the greater force carries it, which is the consent of 
the majority: or else it is impossible it should act or continue 
one body, one community, which the consent of every individual 
that united into it, agreed that it should; and so every one is 
bound by that consent to be concluded by the majority.  And 
therefore we see, that in assemblies, impowered to act by 
positive laws, where no number is set by that positive law which 
impowers them, the act of the majority passes for the act of the 
whole, and of course determines, as having, by the law of nature 
and reason, the power of the whole.  
     Sec. 97.  And thus every man, by consenting with others to 
make one body politic under one government, puts himself under an 
obligation, to every one of that society, to submit to the 
determination of the majority, and to be concluded by it; or else 
this original compact, whereby he with others incorporates into 
one society, would signify nothing, and be no compact, if he be 
left free, and under no other ties than he was in before in the 
state of nature.  For what appearance would there be of any 
compact? what new engagement if he were no farther tied by any 
decrees of the society, than he himself thought fit, and did 
actually consent to?  This would be still as great a liberty, as 
he himself had before his compact, or any one else in the state 
of nature hath, who may submit himself, and consent to any acts 

of it if he thinks fit.  
     Sec. 98.  For if the consent of the majority shall not, in 
reason, be received as the act of the whole, and conclude every 
individual; nothing but the consent of every individual can make 
any thing to be the act of the whole: but such a consent is next 
to impossible ever to be had, if we consider the infirmities of 
health, and avocations of business, which in a number, though 
much less than that of a common-wealth, will necessarily keep 
many away from the public assembly.  To which if we add the 
variety of opinions, and contrariety of interests, which 
unavoidably happen in all collections of men, the coming into 
society upon such terms would be only like Cato's coming into the 
theatre, only to go out again.  Such a constitution as this would 
make the mighty Leviathan of a shorter duration, than the 
feeblest creatures, and not let it outlast the day it was bom in: 
which cannot be supposed, till we can think, that rational 
creatures should desire and constitute societies only to be 
dissolved: for where the majority cannot conclude the rest, there 
they cannot act as one body, and consequently will be immediately 
dissolved again.  
     Sec. 99.  Whosoever therefore out of a state of nature unite 
into a community, must be understood to give up all the power, 
necessary to the ends for which they unite into society, to the 
majority of the community, unless they expresly agreed in any 
number greater than the majority.  And this is done by barely 
agreeing to unite into one political society, which is all the 
compact that is, or needs be, between the individuals, that enter 
into, or make up a commonwealth.  And thus that, which begins and 
actually constitutes any political society, is nothing but the 
consent of any number of freemen capable of a majority to unite 
and incorporate into such a society.  And this is that, and that 
only, which did, or could give beginning to any lawful government 
in the world.  
     Sec. 100.  To this I find two objections made.
     First, That there are no instances to be found in story, of 
a company of men independent, and equal one amongst another, that 
met together, and in this way began and set up a government.  
     Secondly, It is impossible of right, that men should do so, 
because all men being born under government, they are to submit 
to that, and are not at liberty to begin a new one.  
     Sec. 101.  To the first there is this to answer, That it is 
not at all to be wondered, that history gives us but a very 
little account of men, that lived together in the state of 
nature.  The inconveniences of that condition, and the love and 
want of society, no sooner brought any number of them together, 
but they presently united and incorporated, if they designed to 
continue together.  And if we may not suppose men ever to have 
been in the state of nature, because we hear not much of them in 
such a state, we may as well suppose the armies of Salmanasser or 
Xerxes were never children, because we hear little of them, till 
they were men, and imbodied in armies.  Government is every where 
antecedent to records, and letters seldom come in amongst a 
people till a long continuation of civil society has, by other 
more necessary arts, provided for their safety, ease, and plenty: 
and then they begin to look after the history of their founders, 
and search into their original, when they have outlived the 
memory of it: for it is with commonwealths as with particular 
persons, they are commonly ignorant of their own births and 
infancies: and if they know any thing of their original, they are 
beholden for it, to the accidental records that others have kept 
of it.  And those that we have, of the beginning of any polities 
in the world, excepting that of the Jews, where God himself 
immediately interposed, and which favours not at all paternal 
dominion, are all either plain instances of such a beginning as I 
have mentioned, or at least have manifest footsteps of it.  


     Sec. 102.  He must shew a strange inclination to deny 
evident matter of fact, when it agrees not with his hypothesis, 
who will not allow, that shew a strange inclination to deny 
evident matter of fact, when it agrees not with his hypothesis, 
who will not allow, that the beginning of Rome and Venice were by 
the uniting together of several men free and independent one of 
another, amongst whom there was no natural superiority or 
subjection.  And if Josephus Acosta's word may be taken, he tells 
us, that in many parts of America there was no government at all.  
There are great and apparent conjectures, says he, that these 
men, speaking of those of Peru, for a long time had neither kings 
nor commonwealths, but lived in troops, as they do this day in 
Florida, the Cheriquanas, those of Brazil, and many other 
nations, which have no certain kings, but as occasion is offered, 
in peace or war, they choose their captains as they please, 1.  
i.  c.  25.  If it be said, that every man there was born subject 
to his father, or the head of his family; that the subjection due 
from a child to a father took not away his freedom of uniting 
into what political society he thought fit, has been already 
proved.  But be that as it will, these men, it is evident, were 
actually free; and whatever superiority some politicians now 
would place in any of them, they themselves claimed it not, but 
by consent were all equal, till by the same consent they set 
rulers over themselves.  So that their politic societies all 
began from a voluntary union, and the mutual agreement of men 
freely acting in the choice of their governors, and forms of 
government.  
     Sec. 103.  And I hope those who went away from Sparta with 
Palantus, mentioned by Justin, 1. iii. c. 4.  will be allowed to 
have been freemen independent one of another, and to have set up 
a government over themselves, by their own consent.  Thus I have 
given several examples, out of history, of people free and in the 
state of nature, that being met together incorporated and began a 
commonwealth.  And if the want of such instances be an argument 
to prove that government were not, nor could not be so begun, I 
suppose the contenders for paternal empire were better let it 
alone, than urge it against natural liberty: for if they can give 
so many instances, out of history, of governments begun upon 
paternal right, I think (though at best an argument from what has 
been, to what should of right be, has no great force) one might, 
without any great danger, yield them the cause.  But if I might 
advise them in the case, they would do well not to search too 
much into the original of governments, as they have begun de 
facto, lest they should find, at the foundation of most of them, 
something very little favourable to the design they promote, and 
such a power as they contend for.  
     Sec. 104.  But to conclude, reason being plain on our side, 
that men are naturally free, and the examples of history shewing, 
that the governments of the world, that were begun in peace, had 
their beginning laid on that foundation, and were made by the 
consent of the people; there can be little room for doubt, either 
where the right is, or what has been the opinion, or practice of 
mankind, about the first erecting of governments.  
     Sec. 105.  I will not deny, that if we look back as far as 
history will direct us, towards the original of commonwealths, we 
shall generally find them under the government and administration 
of one man.  And I am also apt to believe, that where a family 
was numerous enough to subsist by itself, and continued entire 
together, without mixing with others, as it often happens, where 
there is much land, and few people, the government commonly began 
in the father: for the father having, by the law of nature, the 
same power with every man else to punish, as he thought fit, any 
offences against that law, might thereby punish his transgressing 
children, even when they were men, and out of their pupilage; and 
they were very likely to submit to his punishment, and all join 
with him against the offender, in their turns, giving him thereby 

power to execute his sentence against any transgression, and so 
in effect make him the law-maker, and governor over all that 
remained in conjunction with his family.  He was fittest to be 
trusted; paternal affection secured their property and interest 
under his care; and the custom of obeying him, in their 
childhood, made it easier to submit to him, rather than to any 
other.  If therefore they must have one to rule them, as 
government is hardly to be avoided amongst men that live 
together; who so likely to be the man as he that was their common 
father; unless negligence, cruelty, or any other defect of mind 
or body made him unfit for it?  But when either the father died, 
and left his next heir, for want of age, wisdom, courage, or any 
other qualities, less fit for rule; or where several families 
met, and consented to continue together; there, it is not to be 
doubted, but they used their natural freedom, to set up him, whom 
they judged the ablest, and most likely, to rule well over them.  
Conformable hereunto we find the people of America, who (living 
out of the reach of the conquering swords, and spreading 
domination of the two great empires of Peru and Mexico) enjoyed 
their own natural freedom, though, caeteris paribus, they 
commonly prefer the heir of their deceased king; yet if they find 
him any way weak, or uncapable, they pass him by, and set up the 
stoutest and bravest man for their ruler.  
     Sec. 106.  Thus, though looking back as far as records give 
us any account of peopling the world, and the history of nations, 
we commonly find the government to be in one hand; yet it 
destroys not that which I affirm, viz. that the beginning of 
politic society depends upon the consent of the individuals, to 
join into, and make one society; who, when they are thus 
incorporated, might set up what form of government they thought 
fit.  But this having given occasion to men to mistake, and 
think, that by nature government was monarchical, and belonged to 
the father, it may not be amiss here to consider, why people in 
the beginning generally pitched upon this form, which though 
perhaps the father's pre-eminency might, in the first institution 
of some commonwealths, give a rise to, and place in the 
beginning, the power in one hand; yet it is plain that the 
reason, that continued the form of government in a single person, 
was not any regard, or respect to paternal authority; since all 
petty monarchies, that is, almost all monarchies, near their 
original, have been commonly, at least upon occasion, elective.  
     Sec. 107.  First then, in the beginning of things, the 
father's government of the childhood of those sprung from him, 
having accustomed them to the rule of one man, and taught them 
that where it was exercised with care and skill, with affection 
and love to those under it, it was sufficient to procure and 
preserve to men all the political happiness they sought for in 
society.  It was no wonder that they should pitch upon, and 
naturally run into that form of government, which from their 
infancy they had been all accustomed to; and which, by 
experience, they had found both easy and safe.  To which, if we 
add, that monarchy being simple, and most obvious to men, whom 
neither experience had instructed in forms of government, nor the 
ambition or insolence of empire had taught to beware of the 
encroachments of prerogative, or the inconveniences of absolute 
power, which monarchy in succession was apt to lay claim to, and 
bring upon them, it was not at all strange, that they should not 
much trouble themselves to think of methods of restraining any 
exorbitances of those to whom they had given the authority over 
them, and of balancing the power of government, by placing 
several parts of it in different hands.  They had neither felt 
the oppression of tyrannical dominion, nor did the fashion of the 
age, nor their possessions, or way of living, (which afforded 
little matter for covetousness or ambition) give them any reason 
to apprehend or provide against it; and therefore it is no wonder 
they put themselves into such a frame of government, as was not 

only, as I said, most obvious and simple, but also best suited to 
their present state and condition; which stood more in need of 
defence against foreign invasions and injuries, than of 
multiplicity of laws.  The equality of a simple poor way of 
living, confining their desires within the narrow bounds of each 
man's small property, made few controversies, and so no need of 
many laws to decide them, or variety of officers to superintend 
the process, or look after the execution of justice, where there 
were but few trespasses, and few offenders.  Since then those, 
who like one another so well as to join into society, cannot but 
be supposed to have some acquaintance and friendship together, 
and some trust one in another; they could not but have greater 
apprehensions of others, than of one another: and therefore their 
first care and thought cannot but be supposed to be, how to 
secure themselves against foreign force.  It was natural for them 
to put themselves under a frame of government which might best 
serve to that end, and chuse the wisest and bravest man to 
conduct them in their wars, and lead them out against their 
enemies, and in this chiefly be their ruler.
     Sec. 108.  Thus we see, that the kings of the Indians in 
America, which is still a pattern of the first ages in Asia and 
Europe, whilst the inhabitants were too few for the country, and 
want of people and money gave men no temptation to enlarge their 
possessions of land, or contest for wider extent of ground, are 
little more than generals of their armies; and though they 
command absolutely in war, yet at home and in time of peace they 
exercise very little dominion, and have but a very moderate 
sovereignty, the resolutions of peace and war being ordinarily 
either in the people, or in a council.  Tho' the war itself, 
which admits not of plurality of governors, naturally devolves 
the command into the king's sole authority.
     Sec. 109.  And thus in Israel itself, the chief business of 
their judges, and first kings, seems to have been to be captains 
in war, and leaders of their armies; which (besides what is 
signified by going out and in before the people, which was, to 
march forth to war, and home again in the heads of their forces) 
appears plainly in the story of lephtha.  The Ammonites making 
war upon Israel, the Gileadites in fear send to lephtha, a 
bastard of their family whom they had cast off, and article with 
him, if he will assist them against the Ammonites, to make him 
their ruler; which they do in these words, And the people made 
him head and captain over them, Judg.  xi, ii.  which was, as it 
seems, all one as to be judge.  And he judged Israel, judg.  xii.  
7.  that is, was their captain-general six years.  So when lotham 
upbraids the Shechemites with the obligation they had to Gideon, 
who had been their judge and ruler, he tells them, He fought for 
you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the 
hands of Midian, Judg.  ix.  17.  Nothing mentioned of him but 
what he did as a general: and indeed that is all is found in his 
history, or in any of the rest of the judges.  And Abimelech 
particularly is called king, though at most he was but their 
general.  And when, being weary of the ill conduct of Samuel's 
sons, the children of Israel desired a king, like all the nations 
to judge them, and to go out before them, and to fight their 
battles, I.  Sam viii.  20.  God granting their desire, says to 
Samuel, I will send thee a man, and thou shalt anoint him to be 
captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of 
the hands of the Philistines, ix.  16.  As if the only business 
of a king had been to lead out their armies, and fight in their 
defence; and accordingly at his inauguration pouring a vial of 
oil upon him, declares to Saul, that the Lord had anointed him to 
be captain over his inheritance, x.  1.  And therefore those, who 
after Saul's being solemnly chosen and saluted king by the tribes 
at Mispah, were unwilling to have him their king, made no other 
objection but this, How shall this man save us?  v.  27.  as if 
they should have said, this man is unfit to be our king, not 

having skill and conduct enough in war, to be able to defend us.  
And when God resolved to transfer the government to David, it is 
in these words, But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord 
hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath 
commanded him to be captain over his people, xiii.  14.  As if 
the whole kingly authority were nothing else but to be their 
general: and therefore the tribes who had stuck to Saul's family, 
and opposed David's reign, when they came to Hebron with terms of 
submission to him, they tell him, amongst other arguments they 
had to submit to him as to their king, that he was in effect 
their king in Saul's time, and therefore they had no reason but 
to receive him as their king now.  Also (say they) in time past, 
when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that reddest out and 
broughtest in Israel, and the Lord said unto thee, Thou shalt 
feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.
     Sec. 110.  Thus, whether a family by degrees grew up into a 
common-wealth, and the fatherly authority being continued on to 
the elder son, every one in his turn growing up under it, tacitly 
submitted to it, and the easiness and equality of it not 
offending any one, every one acquiesced, till time seemed to have 
confirmed it, and settled a right of succession by prescription: 
or whether several families, or the descendants of several 
families, whom chance, neighbourhood, or business brought 
together, uniting into society, the need of a general, whose 
conduct might defend them against their enemies in war, and the 
great confidence the innocence and sincerity of that poor but 
virtuous age, (such as are almost all those which begin 
governments, that ever come to last in the world) gave men one of 
another, made the first beginners of commonwealths generally put 
the rule into one man's hand, without any other express 
limitation or restraint, but what the nature of the thing, and 
the end of government required: which ever of those it was that 
at first put the rule into the hands of a single person, certain 
it is no body was intrusted with it but for the public good and 
safety, and to those ends, in the infancies of commonwealths, 
those who had it commonly used it.  And unless they had done so, 
young societies could not have subsisted; without such nursing 
fathers tender and careful of the public weal, all governments 
would have sunk under the weakness and infirmities of their 
infancy, and the prince and the people had soon perished 
together.
     Sec. 111.  But though the golden age (before vain ambition, 
and amor sceleratus habendi, evil concupiscence, had corrupted 
men's minds into a mistake of true power and honour) had more 
virtue, and consequently better governors, as well as less 
vicious subjects, and there was then no stretching prerogative on 
the one side, to oppress the people; nor consequently on the 
other, any dispute about privilege, to lessen or restrain the 
power of the magistrate, and so no contest betwixt rulers and 
people about governors or goveernment: yet, when ambition and 
luxury in future ages* would retain and increase the power, 
without doing the business for which it was given; and aided by 
flattery, taught princes to have distinct and separate interests 
from their people, men found it necessary to examine more 
carefully the original and rights of government; and to find out 
ways to restrain the exorbitances, and prevent the abuses of that 
power, which they having intrusted in another's hands only for 
their own good, they found was made use of to hurt them.
     (*At first, when some certain kind of regiment was once 
approved, it may be nothing was then farther thought upon for the 
manner of governing, but all permitted unto their wisdom and 
discretion which were to rule, till by experience they found this 
for all parts very inconvenient, so as the thing which they had 
devised for a remedy, did indeed but increase the sore which it 
should have cured.  They saw, that to live by one man's will, 
became the cause of all men's misery.  This constrained them to 

come unto laws wherein all men might see their duty before hand, 
and know the penalties of transgressing them.  Hooker's Eccl. 
Pol. l. i. sect. 10.)
    Sec. 112.  Thus we may see how probable it is, that people 
that were naturally free, and by their own consent either 
submitted to the government of their father, or united together 
out of different families to make a government, should generally 
put the rule into one man's hands, and chuse to be under the 
conduct of a single person, without so much as by express 
conditions limiting or regulating his power, which they thought 
safe enough in his honesty and prudence; though they never 
dreamed of  monarchy  being  lure Divino, which we never heard of 
among mankind, till it was revealed to us by the divinity of this 
last age; nor ever allowed paternal power to have a right to 
dominion, or to be the foundation of all  government.  And thus 
much may suffice to shew, that as far as we have any light from 
history, we have reason to conclude, that all peaceful beginnings 
of government have been laid in the consent of the people.  I say 
peaceful, because I shall have occasion in another place to speak 
of conquest, which some esteem a way of beginning of governments.
     The other objection I find urged against the beginning of 
polities, in the way I have mentioned, is this, viz.
     Sec. 113.  That all men being born under government, some or 
other, it is impossible any of them should ever be free, and at 
liberty to unite together, and begin a new one, or ever be able 
to erect a lawful government.
     If this argument be good; I ask, how came so many lawful 
monarchies into the world? for if any body, upon this 
supposition, can shew me any one man in any age of the world free 
to begin a lawful monarchy, I will be bound to shew him ten other 
free men at liberty, at the same time to unite and begin a new 
government under a regal, or any other form; it being 
demonstration, that if any one, born under the dominion of 
another, may be so free as to have a right to command others in a 
new and distinct empire, every one that is born under the 
dominion of another may be so free too, and may become a ruler, 
or subject, of a distinct separate government.   And so by this 
their own principle, either all men, however born, are free, or 
else there is but one lawful prince, one lawful government in the 
world.  And then they have nothing to do, but barely to shew us 
which that is; which when they have done, I doubt not but all 
mankind will easily agree to pay obedience to him.
     Sec. 114.  Though it be a sufficient answer to their 
objection, to shew that it involves them in the same difficulties 
that it doth those they use it against; yet I shall endeavour to 
discover the weakness of this argument a little farther.    All 
men, say they, are born under government, and therefore they 
cannot be at liberty to begin a new one.  Every one is born a 
subject to his father, or his prince, and is therefore under the 
perpetual tie of subjection and allegiance.  It is plain mankind 
never owned nor considered any such natural subjection that they 
were born in, to one or to the other that tied them, without 
their own consents, to a subjection to them and their heirs.
     Sec. 115.  For there are no examples so frequent in history, 
both sacred and profane, as those of men withdrawing themselves, 
and their obedience, from the jurisdiction they were born under, 
and the family or community they were bred up in, and setting up 
new governments in other places; from whence sprang all that 
number of petty commonwealths in the beginning of ages, and which 
always multiplied, as long as there was room enough, till the 
stronger, or more fortunate, swallowed the weaker; and those 
great ones again breaking to pieces, dissolved into lesser 
dominions.  All which are so many testimonies against paternal 
sovereignty, and plainly prove, that it was not the natural right 
of the father descending to his heirs, that made governments in 
the beginning, since it was impossible, upon that ground, there 

should have been so many little kingdoms; all must have been but 
only one universal monarchy, if men had not been at liberty to 
separate themselves from their families, and the government, be 
it what it will, that was set up in it, and go and make distinct 
commonwealths and other governments, as they thought fit.
     Sec. 116.  This has been the practice of the world from its 
first beginning to this day; nor is it now any more hindrance to 
the freedom of mankind, that they are born under constituted and 
ancient polities, that have established laws, and set forms of 
government, than if they were born in the woods, amongst the 
unconfined inhabitants, that run loose in them: for those, who 
would persuade us, that by being born under any government, we 
are naturally subjects to it, and have no more any title or 
pretence to the freedom of the state of nature, have no other 
reason (bating that of paternal power, which we have already 
answered) to produce for it, but only, because our fathers or 
progenitors passed away their natural liberty, and thereby bound 
up themselves and their posterity to a perpetual subjection to 
the government, which they themselves submitted to.  It is true, 
that whatever engagements or promises any one has made for 
himself, he is under the obligation of them, but cannot, by any 
compact whatsoever, bind his children or posterity: for his son, 
when a man, being altogether as free as the father, any act of 
the father can no more give away the liberty of the son, than it 
can of any body else: he may indeed annex such conditions to the 
land, he enjoyed as a subject of any common-wealth, as may oblige 
his son to be of that community, if he will enjoy those 
possessions which were his father's; because that estate being 
his father's property, he may dispose, or settle it, as he 
pleases.
     Sec. 117.  And this has generally given the occasion to 
mistake in this matter; because commonwealths not permitting any 
part of their dominions to be dismembered, nor to be enjoyed by 
any but those of their community, the son cannot ordinarily enjoy 
the possessions of his father, but under the same terms his 
father did, by becoming a member of the society; whereby he puts 
himself presently under the government he finds there 
established, as much as any other subject of that common-wealth.  
And thus the consent of freemen, born under government, which 
only makes them members of it, being given separately in their 
turns, as each comes to be of age, and not in a multitude 
together; people take no notice of it, and thinking it not done 
at all, or not necessary, conclude they are naturally subjects as 
they are men.
     Sec. 118.  But, it is plain, governments themselves 
understand it otherwise; they claim no power over the son, 
because of that they had over the father; nor look on children as 
being their subjects, by their fathers being so.  If a subject of 
England have a child, by an English woman in France, whose 
subject is he?  Not the king of England's; for he must have leave 
to be admitted to the privileges of it: nor the king of France's; 
for how then has his father a liberty to bring him away, and 
breed him as he pleases? and who ever was judged as a traytor or 
deserter, if he left, or warred against a country, for being 
barely born in it of parents that were aliens there?  It is plain 
then, by the practice of governments themselves, as well as by 
the law of right reason, that a child is born a subject of no 
country or government.  He is under his father's tuition and 
authority, till he comes to age of discretion; and then he is a 
freeman, at liberty what government he will put himself under, 
what body politic he will unite himself to: for if an 
Englishman's son, born in France, be at liberty, and may do so, 
it is evident there is no tie upon him by his father's being a 
subject of this kingdom; nor is he bound up by any compact of his 
ancestors.  And why then hath not his son, by the same reason, 
the same liberty, though he be born any where else?  Since the 

power that a father hath naturally over his children, is the 
same, where-ever they be born, and the ties of natural 
obligations, are not bounded by the positive limits of kingdoms 
and commonwealths.
     Sec. 119.  Every man being, as has been shewed, naturally 
free, and nothing being able to put him into subjection to any 
earthly power, but only his own consent; it is to be considered, 
what shall be understood to be a sufficient declaration of a 
man's consent, to make him subject to the laws of any government.  
There is a common distinction of an express and a tacit consent, 
which will concern our present case.  No body doubts but an 
express consent, of any man entering into any society, makes him 
a perfect member of that society, a subject of that government.  
The difficulty is, what ought to be looked upon as a tacit 
consent, and how far it binds, i.e.   how far any one shall be 
looked on to have consented, and thereby submitted to any 
government, where he has made no expressions of it at all.  And 
to this I say, that every man, that hath any possessions, or 
enjoyment, of any part of the dominions of any government, cloth 
thereby give his tacit consent, and is as far forth obliged to 
obedience to the laws of that government, during such enjoyment, 
as any one under it; whether this his possession be of land, to 
him and his heirs for ever, or a lodging only for a week; or 
whether it be barely travelling freely on the highway; and in 
effect, it reaches as far as the very being of any one within the 
territories of that government.
     Sec. 120.  To understand this the better, it is fit to 
consider, that every man, when he at first incorporates himself 
into any commonwealth, he, by his uniting himself thereunto, 
annexed also, and submits to the community, those possessions, 
which he has, or shall acquire, that do not already belong to any 
other government: for it would be a direct contradiction, for any 
one to enter into society with others for the securing and 
regulating of property; and yet to suppose his land, whose 
property is to be regulated by the laws of the society, should be 
exempt from the jurisdiction of that government, to which he 
himself, the proprietor of the land, is a subject.   By the same 
act therefore, whereby any one unites his person, which was 
before free, to any common-wealth, by the same he unites his 
possessions, which were before free, to it also; and they become, 
both of them, person and possession, subject to the government 
and dominion of that common-wealth, as long as it hath a being.  
VVhoever therefore, from thenceforth, by inheritance, purchase, 
permission, or otherways, enjoys any part of the land, so annexed 
to, and under the government of that common-wealth, must take it 
with the condition it is under; that is, of submitting to the 
government of the common-wealth, under whose jurisdiction it is, 
as far forth as any subject of it.
     Sec. 121.  But since the government has a direct 
jurisdiction only over the land, and reaches the possessor of it, 
(before he has actually incorporated himself in the society) only 
as he dwells upon, and enjoys that; the obligation any one is 
under, by virtue of such enjoyment, to submit to the government, 
begins and ends with the enjoyment; so that whenever the owner, 
who has given nothing but such a tacit consent to the government, 
will, by donation, sale, or otherwise, quit the said possession, 
he is at liberty to go and incorporate himself into any other 
common-wealth; or to agree with others to begin a new one, in 
vacuis locis, in any part of the world, they can find free and 
unpossessed: whereas he, that has once, by actual agreement, and 
any express declaration, given his consent to be of any common-
wealth, is perpetually and indispensably obliged to be, and 
remain unalterably a subject to it, and can never be again in the 
liberty of the state of nature; unless, by any calamity, the 
government he was under comes to be dissolved; or else by some 
public act cuts him off from being any longer a member of it.

     Sec. 122.  But submitting to the laws of any country, living 
quietly, and enjoying privileges and protection under them, makes 
not a man a member of that society: this is only a local 
protection and homage due to and from all those, who, not being 
in a state of war, come within the territories belonging to any 
government, to all parts whereof the force of its laws extends.  
But this no more makes a man a member of that society, a 
perpetual subject of that common-wealth, than it would make a man 
a subject to another, in whose family he found it convenient to 
abide for some time; though, whilst he continued in it, he were 
obliged to comply with the laws, and submit to the government he 
found there.  And thus we see, that foreigners, by living all 
their lives under another government, and enjoying the privileges 
and protection of it, though they are bound, even in conscience, 
to submit to its administration, as far forth as any denison; yet 
do not thereby come to be subjects or members of that common-
wealth.  Nothing can make any man so, but his actually entering 
into it by positive engagement, and express promise and compact.  
This is that, which I think, concerning the beginning of 
political societies, and that consent which makes any one a 
member of any common-wealth.

    Sec. 123.  IF man in the state of nature be so free, as has 
been said; if he be absolute lord of his own person and 
possessions, equal to the greatest, and subject to no body, why 
will he part with his freedom? why will he give up this empire, 
and subject himself to the dominion and controul of any other 
power?  To which it is obvious to answer, that though in the 
state of nature he hath such a right, yet the enjoyment of it is 
very uncertain, and constantly exposed to the invasion of others: 
for all being kings as much as he, every man his equal, and the 
greater part no strict observers of equity and justice, the 
enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, 
very unsecure.  This makes him willing to quit a condition, 
which, however free, is full of fears and continual dangers: and 
it is not without reason, that he seeks out, and is willing to 
join in society with others, who are already united, or have a 
mind to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives, 
liberties and estates, which I call by the general name, 
property.
     Sec. 124.  The great and chief end, therefore, of men's 
uniting into commonwealths, and putting themselves under 
government, is the preservation of their property.  To which in 
the state of nature there are many things wanting.   
     First, There wants an established, settled, known law, 
received and allowed by common consent to be the standard of 
right and wrong, and the common measure to decide all 
controversies between them: for though the law of nature be plain 
and intelligible to all rational creatures; yet men being biassed 
by their interest, as well as ignorant for want of study of it, 
are not apt to allow of it as a law binding to them in the 
application of it to their particular cases.
     Sec. 125.  Secondly, In the state of nature there wants a 
known and indifferent judge, with authority to determine all 
differences according to the established law: for every one in 
that state being both judge and executioner of the law of nature, 
men being partial to themselves, passion and revenge is very apt 
to carry them too far, and with too much heat, in their own 
cases; as well as negligence, and unconcernedness, to make them 
too remiss in other men's.

     Sec. 126.  Thirdly, In the state of nature there often wants 
power to back and support the sentence when right, and to give it 
due execution, They who by any injustice offended, will seldom 
fail, where they are able, by force to make good their injustice; 
such resistance many times makes the punishment dangerous, and 
frequently destructive, to those who attempt it.
     Sec. 127.  Thus mankind, notwithstanding all the privileges 
of the state of nature, being but in an ill condition, while they 
remain in it, are quickly driven into society.  Hence it comes to 
pass, that we seldom find any number of men live any time 
together in this state.   The inconveniencies that they are 
therein exposed to, by the irregular and uncertain exercise of 
the power every man has of punishing the transgressions of 
others, make them take sanctuary under the established laws of 
government, and therein seek the preservation of their property.  
It is this makes them so willingly give up every one his single 
power of punishing, to be exercised by such alone, as shall be 
appointed to it amongst them; and by such rules as the community, 
or those authorized by them to that purpose, shall agree on.  And 
in this we have the original right and rise of both the 
legislative and executive power, as well as of the governments 
and societies themselves.
     Sec. 128.  For in the state of nature, to omit the liberty 
he has of innocent delights, a man has two powers.
     The first is to do whatsoever he thinks fit for the 
preservation of himself, and others within the permission of the 
law of nature: by which law, common to them all, he and all the 
rest of mankind are one community, make up one society, distinct 
from all other creatures.  And were it not for the corruption and 
vitiousness of degenerate men, there would be no need of any 
other; no necessity that men should separate from this great and 
natural community, and by positive agreements combine into 
smaller and divided associations.
     The other power a man has in the state of nature, is the 
power to punish the crimes committed against that law.  Both 
these he gives up, when he joins in a private, if I may so call 
it, or particular politic society, and incorporates into any 
common-wealth, separate from the rest of mankind.
     Sec. 129.  The first power, viz.  of doing whatsoever he 
thought for the preservation of himself, and the rest of mankind, 
he gives up to be regulated by laws made by the society, so far 
forth as the preservation of himself, and the rest of that 
society shall require; which laws of the society in many things 
confine the liberty he had by the law of nature.
     Sec. 130.  Secondly, The power of punishing he wholly gives 
up, and engages his natural force, (which he might before employ 
in the execution of the law of nature, by his own single 
authority, as he thought fit) to assist the executive power of 
the society, as the law thereof shall require: for being now in a 
new state, wherein he is to enjoy many conveniencies, from the 
labour, assistance, and society of others in the same community, 
as well as protection from its whole strength; he is to part also 
with as much of his natural liberty, in providing for himself, as 
the good, prosperity, and safety of the society shall require; 
which is not only necessary, but just, since the other members of 
the society do the like.
     Sec. 131.  But though men, when they enter into society, 
give up the equality, liberty, and executive power they had in 
the state of nature, into the hands of the society, to be so far 
disposed of by the legislative, as the good of the society shall 
require; yet it being only with an intention in every one the 
better to preserve himself, his liberty and property; (for no 
rational creature can be supposed to change his condition with an 
intention to be worse) the power of the society, or legislative 
constituted by them, can never be supposed to extend farther, 
than the common good; but is obliged to secure every one's 

property, by providing against those three defects above 
mentioned, that made the state of nature so unsafe and uneasy.  
And so whoever has the legislative or supreme power of any 
common-wealth, is bound to govern by established standing laws, 
promulgated and known to the people, and not by extemporary 
decrees; by indifferent and upright judges, who are to decide 
controversies by those laws; and to employ the force of the 
community at home, only in the execution of such laws, or abroad 
to prevent or redress foreign injuries, and secure the community 
from inroads and invasion.  And all this to be directed to no 
other end, but the peace, safety, and public good of the people.

   

                         CHAP.  X.

             Of the Forms of a Common-wealth.

    Sec. 132.  THE majority having, as has been shewed, upon 
men's first uniting into society, the whole power of the 
community naturally in them, may employ all that power in making 
laws for the community from time to time, and executing those 
laws by officers of their own appointing; and then the form of 
the government is a perfect democracy: or else may put the power 
of making laws into the hands of a few select men, and their 
heirs or successors; and then it is an oligarchy: or else into 
the hands of one man, and then it is a monarchy: if to him and 
his heirs, it is an hereditary monarchy: if to him only for life, 
but upon his death the power only of nominating a successor to 
return to them; an elective monarchy.  And so accordingly of 
these the community may make compounded and mixed forms of 
government, as they think good.  And if the legislative power be 
at first given by the majority to one or more persons only for 
their lives, or any limited time, and then the supreme power to 
revert to them again; when it is so reverted, the community may 
dispose of it again anew into what hands they please, and so 
constitute a new form of government: for the form of government 
depending upon the placing the supreme power, which is the 
legislative, it being impossible to conceive that an inferior 
power should prescribe to a superior, or any but the supreme make 
laws, according as the power of making laws is placed, such is 
the form of the common-wealth.
     Sec. 133.  By common-wealth, I must be understood all along 
to mean, not a democracy, or any form of government, but any 
independent community, which the Latines signified by the word 
civitas, to which the word which best answers in our language, is 
common-wealth, and most properly expresses such a society of men, 
which community or city in English does not; for there may be 
subordinate communities in a government; and city amongst us has 
a quite different notion from common-wealth: and therefore, to 
avoid ambiguity, I crave leave to use the word common-wealth in 
that sense, in which I find it used by king James the first; and 
I take it to be its genuine signification; which if any body 
dislike, I consent with him to change it for a better.



                        CHAP.  XI.

         Of the Extent of the Legislative Power.

     Sec. 134.  THE great end of men's entering into society, 
being the enjoyment of their properties in peace and safety, and 
the great instrument and means of that being the laws established 
in that society; the first and fundamental positive law of all 
commonwealths is the establishing of the legislative power; as 

the first and fundamental natural law, which is to govern even 
the legislative itself, is the preservation of the society, and 
(as far as will consist with the public good) of every person in 
it.  This legislative is not only the supreme power of the 
common-wealth, but sacred and unalterable in the hands where the 
community have once placed it; nor can any edict of any body 
else, in what form soever conceived, or by what power soever 
backed, have the force and obligation of a law, which has not its 
sanction from that legislative which the public has chosen and 
appointed: for without this the law could not have that, which is 
absolutely necessary to its being a law, * the consent of the 
society, over whom no body can have a power to make laws, but by 
their own consent, and by authority received from them; and 
therefore all the obedience, which by the most solemn ties any 
one can be obliged to pay, ultimately terminates in this supreme 
power, and is directed by those laws which it enacts: nor can any 
oaths to any foreign power whatsoever, or any domestic 
subordinate power, discharge any member of the society from his 
obedience to the legislative, acting pursuant to their trust; nor 
oblige him to any obedience contrary to the laws so enacted, or 
farther than they do allow; it being ridiculous to imagine one 
can be tied ultimately to obey any power in the society, which is 
not the supreme.
     (*The lawful power of making laws to command whole politic 
societies of men, belonging so properly unto the same intire 
societies, that for any prince or potentate of what kind soever 
upon earth, to exercise the same of himself, and not by express 
commission immediately and personally received from God, or else 
by authority derived at the first from their consent, upon whose 
persons they impose laws, it is no better than mere tyranny.  
Laws they are not therefore which public approbation hath not 
made so.  Hooker's Eccl. Pol. l. i. sect. 10.  Of this point 
therefore we are to note, that sith men naturally have no full 
and perfect power to command whole politic multitudes of men, 
therefore utterly without our consent, we could in such sort be 
at no man's commandment living.  And to be commanded we do 
consent, when that society, whereof we be a part, hath at any 
time before consented, without revoking the same after by the 
like universal agreement.
     Laws therefore human, of what kind so ever, are available by 
consent.  Ibid.)
     Sec. 135.  Though the legislative, whether placed in one or 
more, whether it be always in being, or only by intervals, though 
it be the supreme power in every common-wealth; yet,
     First, It is not, nor can possibly be absolutely arbitrary 
over the lives and fortunes of the people: for it being but the 
joint power of every member of the society given up to that 
person, or assembly, which is legislator; it can be no more than 
those persons had in a state of nature before they entered into 
society, and gave up to the community: for no body can transfer 
to another more power than he has in himself; and no body has an 
absolute arbitrary power over himself, or over any other, to 
destroy his own life, or take away the life or property of 
another.  A man, as has been proved, cannot subject himself to 
the arbitrary power of another; and having in the state of nature 
no arbitrary power over the life, liberty, or possession of 
another, but only so much as the law of nature gave him for the 
preservation of himself, and the rest of mankind; this is all he 
cloth, or can give up to the common-wealth, and by it to the 
legislative power, so that the legislative can have no more than 
this.   Their power, in the utmost bounds of it, is limited to 
the public good of the society.  It is a power, that hath no 
other end but preservation, and therefore can never* have a right 
to destroy, enslave, or designedly to impoverish the subjects.  
The obligations of the law of nature cease not in society, but 
only in many cases are drawn closer, and have by human laws known 

penalties annexed to them, to inforce their observation.  Thus 
the law of nature stands as an eternal rule to all men, 
legislators as well as others.  The rules that they make for 
other men's actions, must, as well as their own and other men's 
actions, be conformable to the law of nature, i.e.  to the will 
of God, of which that is a declaration, and the fundamental law 
of nature being the preservation of mankind, no human sanction 
can be good, or valid against it.
     (*Two foundations there are which bear up public societies; 
the one a natural inclination, whereby all men desire sociable 
life and fellowship; the other an order, expresly or secretly 
agreed upon, touching the manner of their union in living 
together: the latter is that which we call the law of a common-
weal, the very soul of a politic body, the parts whereof are by 
law animated, held together, and set on work in such actions as 
the common good requireth.  Laws politic, ordained for external 
order and regiment amongst men, are never framed as they should 
be, unless presuming the will of man to be inwardly obstinate, 
rebellious, and averse from all obedience to the sacred laws of 
his nature; in a word, unless presuming man to be, in regard of 
his depraved mind, little better than a wild beast, they do 
accordingly provide, notwithstanding, so to frame his outward 
actions, that they be no hindrance unto the common good, for 
which societies are instituted.  Unless they do this, they are 
not perfect.  Hooker's Eccl. Pol. l. i. sect. 10.)
     Sec. 136.  Secondly,* The legislative, or supreme authority, 
cannot assume to its self a power to rule by extemporary 
arbitrary decrees, but is bound to dispense justice, and decide 
the rights of the subject by promulgated standing laws, and known 
authorized judges: for the law of nature being unwritten, and so 
no where to be found but in the minds of men, they who through 
passion or interest shall miscite, or misapply it, cannot so 
easily be convinced of their mistake where there is no 
established judge: and so it serves not, as it ought, to 
determine the rights, and fence the properties of those that live 
under it, especially where every one is judge, interpreter, and 
executioner of it too, and that in his own case: and he that has 
right on his side, having ordinarily but his own single strength, 
hath not force enough to defend himself from injuries, or to 
punish delinquents.  To avoid these inconveniences, which 
disorder men's propperties in the state of nature, men unite into 
societies, that they may have the united strength of the whole 
society to secure and defend their properties, and may have 
standing rules to bound it, by which every one may know what is 
his.  To this end it is that men give up all their natural power 
to the society which they enter into, and the community put the 
legislative power into such hands as they think fit, with this 
trust, that they shall be governed by declared laws, or else 
their peace, quiet, and property will still be at the same 
uncertainty, as it was in the state of nature.
     (*Human laws are measures in respect of men whose actions 
they must direct, howbeit such measures they are as have also 
their higher rules to be measured by, which rules are two, the 
law of God, and the law of nature; so that laws human must be 
made according to the general laws of nature, and without 
contradiction to any positive law of scripture, otherwise they 
are ill made.  Hooker's Eccl. Pol. l. iii. sect. 9.
     To constrain men to any thing inconvenient cloth seem 
unreasonable.  Ibid. l. i. sect. 10.)
     Sec. 137.  Absolute arbitrary power, or governing without 
settled standing laws, can neither of them consist with the ends 
of society and government, which men would not quit the freedom 
of the state of nature for, and tie themselves up under, were it 
not to preserve their lives, liberties and fortunes, and by 
stated rules of right and property to secure their peace and 
quiet.  It cannot be supposed that they should intend, had they a 

power so to do, to give to any one, or more, an absolute 
arbitrary power over their persons and estates, and put a force 
into the magistrate's hand to execute his unlimited will 
arbitrarily upon them.  This were to put themselves into a worse 
condition than the state of nature, wherein they had a liberty to 
defend their right against the injuries of others, and were upon 
equal terms of force to maintain it, whether invaded by a single 
man, or many in combination.  Whereas by supposing they have 
given up themselves to the absolute arbitrary power and will of a 
legislator, they have disarmed themselves, and armed him, to make 
a prey of them when he pleases; he being in a much worse 
condition, who is exposed to the arbitrary power of one man, who 
has the command of 100,000, than he that is exposed to the 
arbitrary power of 100,000 single men; no body being secure, that 
his will, who has such a command, is better than that of other 
men, though his force be 100,000 times stronger.  And therefore, 
whatever form the common-wealth is under, the ruling power ought 
to govern by declared and received laws, and not by extemporary 
dictates and undetermined resolutions: for then mankind will be 
in a far worse condition than in the state of nature, if they 
shall have armed one, or a few men with the joint power of a 
multitude, to force them to obey at pleasure the exorbitant and 
unlimited decrees of their sudden thoughts, or unrestrained, and 
till that moment unknown wills, without having any measures set 
down which may guide and justify their actions: for all the power 
the government has, being only for the good of the society, as it 
ought not to be arbitrary and at pleasure, so it ought to be 
exercised by established and promulgated laws; that both the 
people may know their duty, and be safe and secure within the 
limits of the law; and the rulers too kept within their bounds, 
and not be tempted, by the power they have in their hands, to 
employ it to such purposes, and by such measures, as they would 
not have known, and own not willingly.
     Sec. 138.  Thirdly, The supreme power cannot take from any 
man any part of his property without his own consent: for the 
preservation of property being the end of government, and that 
for which men enter into society, it necessarily supposes and 
requires, that the people should have property, without which 
they must be supposed to lose that, by entering into society, 
which was the end for which they entered into it; too gross an 
absurdity for any man to own.   Men therefore in society having 
property, they have such a right to the goods, which by the law 
of the community are their's, that no body hath a right to take 
their substance or any part of it from them, without their own 
consent: without this they have no property at all; for I have 
truly no property in that, which another can by right take from 
me, when he pleases, against my consent.  Hence it is a mistake 
to think, that the supreme or legislative power of any common-
wealth, can do what it will, and dispose of the estates of the 
subject arbitrarily, or take any part of them at pleasure.  This 
is not much to be feared in governments where the legislative 
consists, wholly or in part, in assemblies which are variable, 
whose members, upon the dissolution of the assembly, are subjects 
under the common laws of their country, equally with the rest.  
But in governments, where the legislative is in one lasting 
assembly always in being, or in one man, as in absolute 
monarchies, there is danger still, that they will think 
themselves to have a distinct interest from the rest of the 
community; and so will be apt to increase their own riches and 
power, by taking what they think fit from the people: for a man's 
property is not at all secure, tho' there be good and equitable 
laws to set the bounds of it between him and his fellow subjects, 
if he who commands those subjects have power to take from any 
private man, what part he pleases of his property, and use and 
dispose of it as he thinks good.
     Sec. 139.  But government, into whatsoever hands it is put, 

being, as I have before shewed, intrusted with this condition, 
and for this end, that men might have and secure their 
properties; the prince, or senate, however it may have power to 
make laws, for the regulating of property between the subjects 
one amongst another, yet can never have a power to take to 
themselves the whole, or any part of the subjects property, 
without their own consent: for this would be in effect to leave 
them no property at all.  And to let us see, that even absolute 
power, where it is necessary, is not arbitrary by being absolute, 
but is still limited by that reason, and confined to those ends, 
which required it in some cases to be absolute, we need look no 
farther than the common practice of martial discipline: for the 
preservation of the army, and in it of the whole common-wealth, 
requires an absolute obedience to the command of every superior 
officer, and it is justly death to disobey or dispute the most 
dangerous or unreasonable of them; but yet we see, that neither 
the serjeant, that could command a soldier to march up to the 
mouth of a cannon, or stand in a breach, where he is almost sure 
to perish, can command that soldier to give him one penny of his 
money; nor the general, that can condemn him to death for 
deserting his post, or for not obeying the most desperate orders, 
can yet, with all his absolute power of life and death, dispose 
of one farthing of that soldier's estate, or seize one jot of his 
goods; whom yet he can command any thing, and hang for the least 
disobedience; because such a blind obedience is necessary to that 
end, for which the commander has his power, viz.  the 
preservation of the rest; but the disposing of his goods has 
nothing to do with it.
     Sec. 140.  It is true, governments cannot be supported 
without great charge, and it is fit every one who enjoys his 
share of the protection, should pay out of his estate his 
proportion for the maintenance of it.   But still it must be with 
his own consent, i.e.  the consent of the majority, giving it 
either by themselves, or their representatives chosen by them: 
for if any one shall claim a power to lay and levy taxes on the 
people, by his own authority, and without such consent of the 
people, he thereby invades the fundamental law of property, and 
subverts the end of government: for what property have I in that, 
which another may by right take, when he pleases, to himself?
     Sec. 141.  Fourthly, The legislative cannot transfer the 
power of making laws to any other hands: for it being but a 
delegated power from the people, they who have it cannot pass it 
over to others.  The people alone can appoint the form of the 
common-wealth, which is by constituting the legislative, and 
appointing in whose hands that shall be.  And when the people 
have said, We will submit to rules, and be governed by laws made 
by such men, and in such forms, no body else can say other men 
shall make laws for them; nor can the people be bound by any 
laws, but such as are enacted by those whom they have chosen, and 
authorized to make laws for them.   The power of the legislative, 
being derived from the people by a positive voluntary grant and 
institution, can be no other than what that positive grant 
conveyed, which being only to make laws, and not to make 
legislators, the legislative can have no power to transfer their 
authority of making laws, and place it in other hands.
     Sec. 142.  These are the bounds which the trust, that is put 
in them by the society, and the law of God and nature, have set 
to the legislative power of every common-wealth, in all forms of 
government.
     First, They are to govern by promulgated established laws, 
not to be varied in particular cases, but to have one rule for 
rich and poor, for the favourite at court, and the country man at 
plough.
     Secondly, These laws also ought to be designed for no other 
end ultimately, but the good of the people.
     Thirdly, They must not raise taxes on the property of the 

people, without the consent of the people, given by themselves, 
or their deputies.  And this properly concerns only such 
governments where the legislative is always in being, or at least 
where the people have not reserved any part of the legislative to 
deputies, to be from time to time chosen by themselves.
     Fourthly, The legislative neither must nor can transfer the 
power of making laws to any body else, or place it any where, but 
where the people have.



                       CHAP.  XII.

       Of the Legislative, Executive, and Federative
               Power of the Common-wealth.

     Sec. 143.  THE legislative power is that, which has a right 
to direct how the force of the common-wealth shall be employed 
for preserving the community and the members of it.  But because 
those laws which are constantly to be executed, and whose force 
is always to continue, may be made in a little time; therefore 
there is no need, that the legislative should be always in being, 
not having always business to do.  And because it may be too 
great a temptation to human frailty, apt to grasp at power, for 
the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also 
in their hands the power to execute them, whereby they may exempt 
themselves from obedience to the laws they make, and suit the 
law, both in its making, and execution, to their own private 
advantage, and thereby come to have a distinct interest from the 
rest of the community, contrary to the end of society and 
government: therefore in well
ordered commonwealths, where the good of the whole is so con
sidered, as it ought, the legislative power is put into the hands 
of divers persons, who duly assembled, have by themselves, or 
jointly with others, a power to make laws, which when they have 
done, being separated again, they are themselves subject to the 
laws they have made; which is a new and near tie upon them, to 
take care, that they make them for the public good.
     Sec. 144.  But because the laws, that are at once, and in a 
short time made, have a constant and lasting force, and need a 
perpetual execution, or an attendance thereunto; therefore it is 
necessary there should be a power always in being, which should 
see to the execution of the laws that are made, and remain in 
force.  And thus the legislative and executive power come often 
to be separated.
     Sec. 145.  There is another power in every common-wealth, 
which one may call natural, because it is that which answers to 
the power every man naturally had before he entered into society: 
for though in a common-wealth the members of it are distinct 
persons still in reference to one another, and as such as 
governed by the laws of the society; yet in reference to the rest 
of mankind, they make one body, which is, as every member of it 
before was, still in the state of nature with the rest of 
mankind.  Hence it is, that the controversies that happen between 
any man of the society with those that are out of it, are managed 
by the public; and an injury done to a member of their body, 
engages the whole in the reparation of it.  So that under this 
consideration, the whole community is one body in the state of 
nature, in respect of all other states or persons out of its 
community.
     Sec. 146.  This therefore contains the power of war and 
peace, leagues and alliances, and all the transactions, with all 
persons and communities without the common-wealth, and may be 
called federative, if any one pleases.  So the thing be 
understood, I am indifferent as to the name.
     Sec. 147.  These two powers, executive and federative, 

though they be really distinct in themselves, yet one 
comprehending the execution of the municipal laws of the society 
within its self, upon all that are parts of it; the other the 
management of the security and interest of the public without, 
with all those that it may receive benefit or damage from, yet 
they are always almost united.  And though this federative power 
in the well or ill management of it be of great moment to the 
common-wealth, yet it is much less capable to be directed by 
antecedent, standing, positive laws, than the executive; and so 
must necessarily be left to the prudence and wisdom of those, 
whose hands it is in, to be managed for the public good: for the 
laws that concern subjects one amongst another, being to direct 
their actions, may well enough precede them.  But what is to be 
done in reference to foreigners, depending much upon their 
actions, and the variation of designs and interests, must be left 
in great part to the prudence of those, who have this power 
committed to them, to be managed by the best of their skill, for 
the advantage of the common-wealth.
     Sec. 148.  Though, as I said, the executive and federative 
power of every community be really distinct in themselves, yet 
they are hardly to be separated, and placed at the same time, in 
the hands of distinct persons: for both of them requiring the 
force of the society for their exercise, it is almost 
impracticable to place the force of the common-wealth in 
distinct, and not subordinate hands; or that the executive and 
federative power should be placed in persons, that might act 
separately, whereby the force of the public would be under 
different commands: which would be apt some time or other to 
cause disorder and ruin.



                    C H A P.  X I I I.

         Of the Subordination of the Powers of the
                      Common-wealth.

     Sec. 149.  THOUGH in a constituted common-wealth, standing 
upon its own basis, and acting according to its own nature, that 
is, acting for the preservation of the community, there can be 
but one supreme power, which is the legislative, to which all the 
rest are and must be subordinate, yet the legislative being only 
a fiduciary power to act for certain ends, there remains still in 
the people a supreme power to remove or alter the legislative, 
when they find the legislative act contrary to the trust reposed 
in them: for all power given with trust for the attaining an end, 
being limited by that end, whenever that end is manifestly 
neglected, or opposed, the trust must necessarily be forfeited, 
and the power devolve into the hands of those that gave it, who 
may place it anew where they shall think best for their safety 
and security.  And thus the community perpetually retains a 
supreme power of saving themselves from the attempts and designs 
of any body, even of their legislators, whenever they shall be so 
foolish, or so wicked, as to lay and carry on designs against the 
liberties and properties of the subject: for no man or society of 
men, having a power to deliver up their preservation, or 
consequently the means of it, to the absolute will and arbitrary 
dominion of another; when ever any one shall go about to bring 
them into such a slavish condition, they will always have a right 
to preserve, what they have not a power to part with; and to rid 
themselves of those, who invade this fundamental, sacred, and 
unalterable law of self-preservation, for which they entered into 
society.  And thus the community may be said in this respect to 
be always the supreme power, but not as considered under any form 
of government, because this power of the people can never take 
place till the government be dissolved.

     Sec. 150.  In all cases, whilst the government subsists, the 
legislative is the supreme power: for what can give laws to 
another, must needs be superior to him; and since the legislative 
is no otherwise legislative of the society, but by the right it 
has to make laws for all the parts, and for every member of the 
society, prescribing rules to their actions, and giving power of 
execution, where they are transgressed, the legislative must 
needs be the supreme, and all other powers, in any members or 
parts of the society, derived from and subordinate to it.
     Sec. 151.  In some commonwealths, where the legislative is 
not always in being, and the executive is vested in a single 
person, who has also a share in the legislative; there that 
single person in a very tolerable sense may also be called 
supreme: not that he has in himself all the supreme power, which 
is that of law-making; but because he has in him the supreme 
execution, from whom all inferior magistrates derive all their 
several subordinate powers, or at least the greatest part of 
them: having also no legislative superior to him, there being no 
law to be made without his consent, which cannot be expected 
should ever subject him to the other part of the legislative, he 
is properly enough in this sense supreme.  But yet it is to be 
observed, that tho' oaths of allegiance and fealty are taken to 
him, it is not to him as supreme legislator, but as supreme 
executor of the law, made by a joint power of him with others; 
allegiance being nothing but an obedience according to law, which 
when he violates, he has no right to obedience, nor can claim it 
otherwise than as the public person vested with the power of the 
law, and so is to be considered as the image, phantom, or 
representative of the common-wealth, acted by the will of the 
society, declared in its laws; and thus he has no will, no power, 
but that of the law.  But when he quits this representation, this 
public will, and acts by his own private will, he degrades 
himself, and is but a single private person without power, and 
without will, that has any right to obedience; the members owing 
no obedience but to the public will of the society.
     Sec. 152.  The executive power, placed any where but in a 
person that has also a share in the legislative, is visibly 
subordinate and accountable to it, and may be at pleasure changed 
and displaced; so that it is not the supreme executive power, 
that is exempt from subordination, but the supreme executive 
power vested in one, who having a share in the legislative, has 
no distinct superior legislative to be subordinate and 
accountable to, farther than he himself shall join and consent; 
so that he is no more subordinate than he himself shall think 
fit, which one may certainly conclude will be but very little.  
Of other ministerial and subordinate powers in a commonwealth, we 
need not speak, they being so multiplied with infinite variety, 
in the different customs and constitutions of distinct 
commonwealths, that it is impossible to give a particular account 
of them all.  Only thus much, which is necessary to our present 
purpose, we may take notice of concerning them, that they have no 
manner of authority, any of them, beyond what is by positive 
grant and commission delegated to them, and are all of them 
accountable to some other power in the common-wealth.
     Sec. 153.  It is not necessary, no, nor so much as 
convenient, that the legislative should be always in being; but 
absolutely necessary that the executive power should, because 
there is not always need of new laws to be made, but always need 
of execution of the laws that are made.  When the legislative 
hath put the execution of the laws, they make, into other hands, 
they have a power still to resume it out of those hands, when 
they find cause, and to punish for any maladministration against 
the laws.  The same holds also in regard of the federative power, 
that and the executive being both ministerial and subordinate to 
the legislative, which, as has been shewed, in a constituted 
common-wealth is the supreme.  The legislative also in this case 

being supposed to consist of several persons, (for if it be a 
single person, it cannot but be always in being, and so will, as 
supreme, naturally have the supreme executive power, together 
with the legislative) may assemble, and exercise their 
legislature, at the times that either their original 
constitution, or their own adjournment, appoints, or when they 
please; if neither of these hath appointed any time, or there be 
no other way prescribed to convoke them: for the supreme power 
being placed in them by the people, it is always in them, and 
they may exercise it when they please, unless by their original 
constitution they are limited to certain seasons, or by an act of 
their supreme power they have adjourned to a certain time; and 
when that time comes, they have a right to assemble and act 
again.
     Sec. 154.  If the legislative, or any part of it, be made up 
of representatives chosen for that time by the people, which 
afterwards return into the ordinary state of subjects, and have 
no share in the legislature but upon a new choice, this power of 
chusing must also be exercised by the people, either at certain 
appointed seasons, or else when they are summoned to it; and in 
this latter case ' the power of convoking the legislative is 
ordinarily placed in the executive, and has one of these two 
limitations in respect of time: that either the original 
constitution requires their assembling and acting at certain 
intervals, and then the executive power does nothing but 
ministerially issue directions for their electing and assembling, 
according to due forms; or else it is left to his prudence to 
call them by new elections, when the occasions or exigencies of 
the public require the amendment of old, or making of new laws, 
or the redress or prevention of any inconveniencies, that lie on, 
or threaten the people.
     Sec. 155.  It may be demanded here, What if the executive 
power, being possessed of the force of the common-wealth, shall 
make use of that force to hinder the meeting and acting of the 
legislative, when the original constitution, or the public 
exigencies require it?  I say, using force upon the people 
without authority, and contrary to the trust put in him that does 
so, is a state of war with the people, who have a right to 
reinstate their legislative in the exercise of their power: for 
having erected a legislative, with an intent they should exercise 
the power of making laws, either at certain set times, or when 
there is need of it, when they are hindered by any force from 
what is so necessary to the society, and wherein the safety and 
preservation of the people consists, the people have a right to 
remove it by force.  In all states and conditions, the true 
remedy of force without authority, is to oppose force to it.  The 
use of force without authority, always puts him that uses it into 
a state of war, as the aggressor, and renders him liable to be 
treated accordingly.
     Sec. 156.  The power of assembling and dismissing the 
legislative, placed in the executive, gives not the executive a 
superiority over it, but is a fiduciary trust placed in him, for 
the safety of the people, in a case where the uncertainty and 
variableness of human affairs could not bear a steady fixed rule: 
for it not being possible, that the first framers of the 
government should, by any foresight, be so much masters of future 
events, as to be able to prefix so just periods of return and 
duration to the assemblies of the legislative, in all times to 
come, that might exactly answer all the exigencies of the common-
wealth; the best remedy could be found for this defect, was to 
trust this to the prudence of one who was always to be present, 
and whose business it was to watch over the public good.   
Constant frequent meetings of the legislative, and long 
continuations of their assemblies, without necessary occasion, 
could not but be burdensome to the people, and must necessarily 
in time produce more dangerous inconveniencies, and yet the quick 

turn of affairs might be sometimes such as to need their present 
help: any delay of their convening might endanger the public; and 
sometimes too their business might be so great, that the limited 
time of their sitting might be too short for their work, and rob 
the public of that benefit which could be had only from their 
mature deliberation.  What then could be done in this case to 
prevent the community from being exposed some time or other to 
eminent hazard, on one side or the other, by fixed intervals and 
periods, set to the meeting and acting of the legislative, but to 
intrust it to the prudence of some, who being present, and 
acquainted with the state of public affairs, might make use of 
this prerogative for the public good? and where else could this 
be so well placed as in his hands, who was intrusted with the 
execution of the laws for the same end?  Thus supposing the 
regulation of times for the assembling and sitting of the 
legislative, not settled by the original constitution, it 
naturally fell into the hands of the executive, not as an 
arbitrary power depending on his good pleasure, but with this 
trust always to have it exercised only for the public weal, as 
the occurrences of times and change of affairs might require.  
Whether settled periods of their convening, or a liberty left to 
the prince for convoking the legislative, or perhaps a mixture of 
both, hath the least inconvenience attending it, it is not my 
business here to inquire, but only to shew, that though the 
executive power may have the prerogative of convoking and 
dissolving such conventions of the legislative, yet it is not 
thereby superior to it.
     Sec. 157.  Things of this world are in so constant a flux, 
that nothing remains long in the same state.  Thus people, 
riches, trade, power, change their stations, flourishing mighty 
cities come to ruin, and prove in times neglected desolate 
corners, whilst other unfrequented places grow into populous 
countries, filled with wealth and inhabitants.  But things not 
always changing equally, and private interest often keeping up 
customs and privileges, when the reasons of them are ceased, it 
often comes to pass, that in governments, where part of the 
legislative consists of representatives chosen by the people, 
that in tract of time this representation becomes very unequal 
and disproportionate to the reasons it was at first established 
upon.   To what gross absurdities the following of custom, when 
reason has left it, may lead, we may be satisfied, when we see 
the bare name of a town, of which there remains not so much as 
the ruins, where scarce so much housing as a sheepcote, or more 
inhabitants than a shepherd is to be found, sends as many 
representatives to the grand assembly of law-makers, as a whole 
county numerous in people, and powerful in riches.  This 
strangers stand amazed at, and every one must confess needs a 
remedy; tho' most think it hard to find one, because the 
constitution of the legislative being the original and supreme 
act of the society, antecedent to all positive laws in it, and 
depending wholly on the people, no inferior power can alter it.   
And therefore the people, when the legislative is once 
constituted, having, in such a government as we have been 
speaking of, no power to act as long as the government stands; 
this inconvenience is thought incapable of a remedy.
     Sec. 158.  Salus populi suprema lex, is certainly so just 
and fundamental a rule, that he, who sincerely follows it, cannot 
dangerously err.  If therefore the executive, who has the power 
of convoking the legislative, observing rather the true 
proportion, than fashion of representation, regulates, not by old 
custom, but true reason, the number of members, in all places 
that have a right to be distinctly represented, which no part of 
the people however incorporated can pretend to, but in proportion 
to the assistance which it affords to the public, it cannot be 
judged to have set up a new legislative, but to have restored the 
old and true one, and to have rectified the disorders which 

succession of time had insensibly, as well as inevitably 
introduced: For it being the interest as well as intention of the 
people, to have a fair and equal representative; whoever brings 
it nearest to that, is an undoubted friend to, and establisher of 
the government, and cannot miss the consent and approbation of 
the community; prerogative being nothing but a power, in the 
hands of the prince, to provide for the public good, in such 
cases, which depending upon unforeseen and uncertain occurrences, 
certain and unalterable laws could not safely direct; whatsoever 
shall be done manifestly for the good of the people, and the 
establishing the government upon its true foundations, is, and 
always will be, just prerogative, The power of erecting new 
corporations, and therewith new representatives, carries with it 
a supposition, that in time the measures of representation might 
vary, and those places have a just right to be represented which 
before had none; and by the same reason, those cease to have a 
right, and be too inconsiderable for such a privilege, which 
before had it.  'Tis not a change from the present state, which 
perhaps corruption or decay has introduced, that makes an inroad 
upon the government, but the tendency of it to injure or oppress 
the people, and to set up one part or party, with a distinction 
from, and an unequal subjection of the rest.  Whatsoever cannot 
but be acknowledged to be of advantage to the society, and people 
in general, upon just and lasting measures, will always, when 
done, justify itself; and whenever the people shall chuse their 
representatives upon just and undeniably equal measures, suitable 
to the original frame of the government, it cannot be doubted to 
be the will and act of the society, whoever permitted or caused 
them so to do.



                        CHAP.  XIV.

                      Of PREROGATIVE.

    Sec. 159.  WHERE the legislative and executive power are in 
distinct hands, (as they are in all moderated monarchies, and 
well-framed governments) there the good of the society requires, 
that several things should be left to the discretion of him that 
has the executive power: for the legislators not being able to 
foresee, and provide by laws, for all that may be useful to the 
community, the executor of the laws having the power in his 
hands, has by the common law of nature a right to make use of it 
for the good of the society, in many cases, where the municipal 
law has given no direction, till the legislative can conveniently 
be assembled to provide for it.  Many things there are, which the 
law can by no means provide for; and those must necessarily be 
left to the discretion of him that has the executive power in his 
hands, to be ordered by him as the public good and advantage 
shall require: nay, it is fit that the laws themselves should in 
some cases give way to the executive power, or rather to this 
fundamental law of nature and government, viz.   That as much as 
may be, all the members of the society are to be preserved: for 
since many accidents may happen, wherein a strict and rigid 
observation of the laws may do harm; (as not to pull down an 
innocent man's house to stop the fire, when the next to it is 
burning) and a man may come sometimes within the reach of the 
law, which makes no distinction of persons, by an action that may 
deserve reward and pardon; 'tis fit the ruler should have a 
power, in many cases, to mitigate the severity of the law, and 
pardon some offenders: for the end of government being the 
preservation of all, as much as may be, even the guilty are to be 
spared, where it can prove no prejudice to the innocent.
     Sec. 160.  This power to act according to discretion, for 
the public good, without the prescription of the law, and 

sometimes even against it, is that which is called prerogative: 
for since in some governments the lawmaking power is not always 
in being, and is usually too numerous, and so too slow, for the 
dispatch requisite to execution; and because also it is 
impossible to foresee, and so by laws to provide for, all 
accidents and necessities that may concern the public, or to make 
such laws as will do no harm, if they are executed with an 
inflexible rigour, on all occasions, and upon all persons that 
may come in their way; therefore there is a latitude left to the 
executive power, to do many things of choice which the laws do 
not prescribe.   
     Sec. 161.  This power, whilst employed for the benefit of 
the community, and suitably to the trust and ends of the 
government, is undoubted prerogative, and never is questioned: 
for the people are very seldom or never scrupulous or nice in the 
point; they are far from examining prerogative, whilst it is in 
any tolerable degree employed for the use it was meant, that is, 
for the good of the people, and not manifestly against it: but if 
there comes to be a question between the executive power and the 
people, about a thing claimed as a prerogative; the tendency of 
the exercise of such prerogative to the good or hurt of the 
people, will easily decide that question.   
     Sec. 162.  It is easy to conceive, that in the infancy of 
governments, when commonwealths differed little from families in 
number of people, they differed from them too but little in 
number of laws: and the governors, being as the fathers of them, 
watching over them for their good, the government was almost all 
prerogative.  A few established laws served the turn, and the 
discretion and care of the ruler supplied the rest.  But when 
mistake or flattery prevailed with weak princes to make use of 
this power for private ends of their own, and not for the public 
good, the people were fain by express laws to get prerogative 
determined in those points wherein they found disadvantage from 
it: and thus declared limitations of prerogative were by the 
people found necessary in cases which they and their ancestors 
had left, in the utmost latitude, to the wisdom of those princes 
who made no other but a right use of it, that is, for the good of 
their people.
     Sec. 163.  And therefore they have a very wrong notion of 
government, who say, that the people have encroached upon the 
prerogative, when they have got any part of it to be defined by 
positive laws: for in so doing they have not pulled from the 
prince any thing that of right belonged to him, but only 
declared, that that power which they indefinitely left in his or 
his ancestors hands, to be exercised for their good, was not a 
thing which they intended him when he used it otherwise: for the 
end of government being the good of the community, whatsoever 
alterations are made in it, tending to that end, cannot be an 
encroachment upon any body, since no body in government can have 
a right tending to any other end: and those only are 
encroachments which prejudice or hinder the public good.  Those 
who say otherwise, speak as if the prince had a distinct and 
separate interest from the good of the community, and was not 
made for it; the root and source from which spring almost all 
those evils and disorders which happen in kingly governments.  
And indeed, if that be so, the people under his government are 
not a society of rational creatures, entered into a community for 
their mutual good; they are not such as have set rulers over 
themselves, to guard, and promote that good; but are to be looked 
on as an herd of inferior creatures under the dominion of a 
master, who keeps them and works them for his own pleasure or 
profit.  If men were so void of reason, and brutish, as to enter 
into society upon such terms, prerogative might indeed be, what 
some men would have it, an arbitrary power to do things hurtful 
to the people.
     Sec. 164.  But since a rational creature cannot be supposed, 

when free, to put himself into subjection to another, for his own 
harm; (though, where he finds a good and wise ruler, he may not 
perhaps think it either necessary or useful to set precise bounds 
to his power in all things) prerogative can be nothing but the 
people's permitting their rulers to do several things, of their 
own free choice, where the law was silent, and sometimes too 
against the direct letter of the law, for the public good; and 
their acquiescing in it when so done: for as a good prince, who 
is mindful of the trust put into his hands, and careful of the 
good of his people, cannot have too much prerogative, that is, 
power to do good; so a weak and ill prince, who would claim that 
power which his predecessors exercised without the direction of 
the law, as a prerogative belonging to him by right of his 
office, which he may exercise at his pleasure, to make or promote 
an interest distinct from that of the public, gives the people an 
occasion to claim their right, and limit that power, which, 
whilst it was exercised for their good, they were content should 
be tacitly allowed.        Sec. 165.  And therefore he that will 
look into the history of England, will find, that prerogative was 
always largest in the hands of our wisest and best princes; 
because the people, observing the whole tendency of their actions 
to be the public good, contested not what was done without law to 
that end: or, if any human frailty or mistake (for princes are 
but men, made as others) appeared in some small declinations from 
that end; yet 'twas visible, the main of their conduct tended to 
nothing but the care of the public.  The people therefore, 
finding reason to be satisfied with these princes, whenever they 
acted without, or contrary to the letter of the law, acquiesced 
in what they did, and, without the least complaint, let them 
inlarge their prerogative as they pleased, judging rightly, that 
they did nothing herein to the prejudice of their laws, since 
they acted conformable to the foundation and end of all laws, the 
public good.
     Sec. 166.  Such god-like princes indeed had some title to 
arbitrary power by that argument, that would prove absolute 
monarchy the best government, as that which God himself governs 
the universe by; because such kings partake of his wisdom and 
goodness.  Upon this is founded that saying, That the reigns of 
good princes have been always most dangerous to the liberties of 
their people: for when their successors, managing the government 
with different thoughts, would draw the actions of those good 
rulers into precedent, and make them the standard of their 
prerogative, as if what had been done only for the good of the 
people was a right in them to do, for the harm of the people, if 
they so pleased; it has often occasioned contest, and sometimes 
public disorders, before the people could recover their original 
right, and get that to be declared not to be prerogative, which 
truly was never so; since it is impossible that any body in the 
society should ever have a right to do the people harm; though it 
be very possible, and reasonable, that the people should not go 
about to set any bounds to the prerogative of those kings, or 
rulers, who themselves transgressed not the bounds of the public 
good: for prerogative is nothing but the power of doing public 
good without a rule.   
     Sec. 167.  The power of calling parliaments in England, as 
to precise time, place, and duration, is certainly a prerogative 
of the king, but still with this trust, that it shall be made use 
of for the good of the nation, as the exigencies of the times, 
and variety of occasions, shall require: for it being impossible 
to foresee which should always be the fittest place for them to 
assemble in, and what the best season; the choice of these was 
left with the executive power, as might be most subservient to 
the public good, and best suit the ends of parliaments.
     Sec. 168.  The old question will be asked in this matter of 
prerogative, But who shall be judge when this power is made a 
right use of ?  1 answer: between an executive power in being, 

with such a prerogative, and a legislative that depends upon his 
will for their convening, there can be no judge on earth; as 
there can be none between the legislative and the people, should 
either the executive, or the legislative, when they have got the 
power in their hands, design, or go about to enslave or destroy 
them.  The people have no other remedy in this, as in all other 
cases where they have no judge on earth, but to appeal to heaven: 
for the rulers, in such attempts, exercising a power the people 
never put into their hands, (who can never be supposed to consent 
that any body should rule over them for their harm) do that which 
they have not a right to do.  And where the body of the people, 
or any single man, is deprived of their right, or is under the 
exercise of a power without right, and have no appeal on earth, 
then they have a liberty to appeal to heaven, whenever they judge 
the cause of sufficient moment.  And therefore, though the people 
cannot be judge, so as to have, by the constitution of that 
society, any superior power, to determine and give effective 
sentence in the case; yet they have, by a law antecedent and 
paramount to all positive laws of men, reserved that ultimate 
determination to themselves which belongs to all mankind, where 
there lies no appeal on earth, viz.  to judge, whether they have 
just cause to make their appeal to heaven.  And this judgment 
they cannot part with, it being out of a man's power so to submit 
himself to another, as to give him a liberty to destroy him; God 
and nature never allowing a man so to abandon himself, as to 
neglect his own preservation: and since he cannot take away his 
own life, neither can he give another power to take it.  Nor let 
any one think, this lays a perpetual foundation for disorder; for 
this operates not, till the inconveniency is so great, that the 
majority feel it, and are weary of it, and find a necessity to 
have it amended.  But this the executive power, or wise princes, 
never need come in the danger of: and it is the thing, of all 
others, they have most need to avoid, as of all others the most 
perilous.




                         CHAP.  XV.

        Of Paternal, Political, and Despotical Power,
                    considered together.

     Sec. 169.  THOUGH I have had occasion to speak of these 
separately before, yet the great mistakes of late about 
government, having, as I suppose, arisen from confounding these 
distinct powers one with another, it may not, perhaps, be amiss 
to consider them here together.
     Sec. 170.  First, then, Paternal or parental power is 
nothing but that which parents have over their children, to 
govern them for the children's good, till they come to the use of 
reason, or a state of knowledge, wherein they may be supposed 
capable to understand that rule, whether it be the law of nature, 
or the municipal law of their country, they are to govern 
themselves by: capable, I say, to know it, as well as several 
others, who live as freemen under that law.  The affection and 
tenderness which God hath planted in the breast of parents 
towards their children, makes it evident, that this is not 
intended to be a severe arbitrary government, but only for the 
help, instruction, and preservation of their offspring.  But 
happen it as it will, there is, as I have proved, no reason why 
it should be thought to extend to life and death, at any time, 
over their children, more than over any body else; neither can 
there be any pretence why this parental power should keep the 
child, when grown to a man, in subjection to the will of his 
parents, any farther than having received life and education from 

his parents, obliges him to respect, honour, gratitude, 
assistance and support, all his life, to both father and mother.  
And thus, 'tis true, the paternal is a natural government, but 
not at all extending itself to the ends and jurisdictions of that 
which is political.  The power of the father doth not reach at 
all to the property of the child, which is only in his own 
disposing.
     Sec. 171.  Secondly, Political power is that power, which 
every man having in the state of nature, has given up into the 
hands of the society, and therein to the governors, whom the 
society hath set over itself, with this express or tacit trust, 
that it shall be employed for their good, and the preservation of 
their property: now this power, which every man has in the state 
of nature, and which he parts with to the society in all such 
cases where the society can secure him, is to use such means, for 
the preserving of his own property, as he thinks good, and nature 
allows him; and to punish the breach of the law of nature in 
others, so as (according to the best of his reason) may most 
conduce to the preservation of himself, and the rest of mankind.  
So that the end and measure of this power, when in every man's 
hands in the state of nature, being the preservation of all of 
his society, that is, all mankind in general, it can have no 
other end or measure, when in the hands of the magistrate, but to 
preserve the members of that society in their lives, liberties, 
and possessions; and so cannot be an absolute, arbitrary power 
over their lives and fortunes, which are as much as possible to 
be preserved; but a power to make laws, and annex such penalties 
to them, as may tend to the preservation of the whole, by cutting 
off those parts, and those only, which are so corrupt, that they 
threaten the sound and healthy, without which no severity is 
lawful.  And this power has its original only from compact and 
agreement, and the mutual consent of those who make up the 
community.
     Sec. 172.  Thirdly, Despotical power is an absolute, 
arbitrary power one man has over another, to take away his life, 
whenever he pleases.  This is a power, which neither nature 
gives, for it has made no such distinction between one man and 
another; nor compact can convey: for man not having such an 
arbitrary power over his own life, cannot give another man such a 
power over it; but it is the effect only of forfeiture, which the 
aggressor makes of his own life, when he puts himself into the 
state of war with another: for having quitted reason, which God 
hath given to be the rule betwixt man and man, and the common 
bond whereby human kind is united into one fellowship and 
society; and having renounced the way of peace which that 
teaches, and made use of the force of war, to compass his unjust 
ends upon another, where he has no right; and so revolting from 
his own kind to that of beasts, by making force, which is 
their's, to be his rule of right, he renders himself liable to be 
destroyed by the injured person, and the rest of mankind, that 
will join with him in the execution of justice, as any other wild 
beast, or noxious brute, with whom mankind can have neither 
society nor security*.  And thus captives, taken in a just and 
lawful war, and such only, are subject to a despotical power, 
which, as it arises not from compact, so neither is it capable of 
any, but is the state of war continued: for what compact can be 
made with a man that is not master of his own life? what 
condition can he perform? and if he be once allowed to be master 
of his own life, the despotical, arbitrary power of his master 
ceases.  He that is master of himself, and his own life, has a 
right too to the means of preserving it; so that as soon as 
compact enters, slavery ceases, and he so far quits his absolute 
power, and puts an end to the state of war, who enters into 
conditions with his captive.
     (*Another copy corrected by Mr.  Locke, has it thus, Noxious 
brute that is destructive to their being.)

     Sec. 173.  Nature gives the first of these, viz.  paternal 
power to parents for the benefit of their children during their 
minority, to supply their want of ability, and understanding how 
to manage their property.  (By property I must be understood 
here, as in other places, to mean that property which men have in 
their persons as well as goods.) Voluntary agreement gives the 
second, viz.  political power to governors for the benefit of 
their subjects, to secure them in the possession and use of their 
properties.  And forfeiture gives the third despotical power to 
lords for their own benefit, over those who are stripped of all 
property.
     Sec. 174.  He, that shall consider the distinct rise and 
extent, and the different ends of these several powers, will 
plainly see, that paternal power comes as far short of that of 
the magistrate, as despotical exceeds it; and that absolute 
dominion, however placed, is so far from being one kind of civil 
society, that it is as inconsistent with it, as slavery is with 
property.  Paternal power is only where minority makes the child 
incapable to manage his property; political, where men have 
property in their own disposal; and despotical, over such as have 
no property at all.



                         CHAP.  XVI.

                         Of CONQUEST.

     Sec. 175.  THOUGH governments can originally have no other 
rise than that before mentioned, nor polities be founded on any 
thing but the consent of the people; yet such have been the 
disorders ambition has filled the world with, that in the noise 
of war, which makes so great a part of the history of mankind, 
this consent is little taken notice of: and therefore many have 
mistaken the force of arms for the consent of the people, and 
reckon conquest as one of the originals of government.  But 
conquest is as far from setting up any government, as demolishing 
an house is from building a new one in the place.  Indeed, it 
often makes way for a new frame of a common-wealth, by destroying 
the former; but, without the consent of the people, can never 
erect a new one. 
       Sec. 176.  That the aggressor, who puts himself into the 
state of war with another, and unjustly invades another man's 
right, can, by such an unjust war, never come to have a right 
over the conquered, will be easily agreed by all men, who will 
not think, that robbers and pyrates have a right of empire over 
whomsoever they have force enough to master; or that men are 
bound by promises, which unlawful force extorts from them.  
Should a robber break into my house, and with a dagger at my 
throat make me seal deeds to convey my estate to him, would this 
give him any title?  Just such a title, by his sword, has an 
unjust conqueror, who forces me into submission.  The injury and 
the crime is equal, whether committed by the wearer of a crown, 
or some petty villain.  The title of the offender, and the number 
of his followers, make no difference in the offence, unless it be 
to aggravate it.  The only difference is, great robbers punish 
little ones, to keep them in their obedience; but the great ones 
are rewarded with laurels and triumphs, because they are too big 
for the weak hands of justice in this world, and have the power 
in their own possession, which should punish offenders.  What is 
my remedy against a robber, that so broke into my house?  Appeal 
to the law for justice.  But perhaps justice is denied, or I am 
crippled and cannot stir, robbed and have not the means to do it.  
If God has taken away all means of seeking remedy, there is 
nothing left but patience.  But my son, when able, may seek the 
relief of the law, which I am denied: he or his son may renew his 

appeal, till he recover his right.  But the conquered, or their 
children, have no court, no arbitrator on earth to appeal to.  
Then they may appeal, as lephtha did, to heaven, and repeat their 
appeal till they have recovered the native right of their 
ancestors, which was, to have such a legislative over them, as 
the majority should approve, and freely acquiesce in.  If it be 
objected, This would cause endless trouble; I answer, no more 
than justice does, where she lies open to all that appeal to her.  
He that troubles his neighbour without a cause, is punished for 
it by the justice of the court he appeals to: and he that appeals 
to heaven must be sure he has right on his side; and a right too 
that is worth the trouble and cost of the appeal, as he will 
answer at a tribunal that cannot be deceived, and will be sure to 
retribute to every one according to the mischiefs he hath created 
to his fellow subjects; that is, any part of mankind: from whence 
it is plain, that he that conquers in an unjust war can thereby 
have no title to the subjection and obedience of the conquered.
     Sec. 177.  But supposing victory favours the right side, let 
us consider a conqueror in a lawful war, and see what power he 
gets, and over whom.
     First, It is plain he gets no power by his conquest over 
those that conquered with him.  They that fought on his side 
cannot suffer by the conquest, but must at least be as much 
freemen as they were before.  And most commonly they serve upon 
terms, and on condition to share with their leader, and enjoy a 
part of the spoil, and other advantages that attend the 
conquering sword; or at least have a part of the subdued country 
bestowed upon them.  And the conquering people are not, I hope, 
to be slaves by conquest, and wear their laurels only to shew 
they are sacrifices to their leaders triumph.  They that found 
absolute monarchy upon the title of the sword, make their heroes, 
who are the founders of such monarchies, arrant Draw-can-sirs, 
and forget they had any officers and soldiers that fought on 
their side in the battles they won, or assisted them in the 
subduing, or shared in possessing, the countries they mastered.  
We are told by some, that the English monarchy is founded in the 
Norman conquest, and that our princes have thereby a title to 
absolute dominion: which if it were true, (as by the history it 
appears otherwise) and that William had a right to make war on 
this island; yet his dominion by conquest could reach no farther 
than to the Saxons and Britons, that were then inhabitants of 
this country.  The Normans that came with him, and helped to 
conquer, and all descended from them, are freemen, and no 
subjects by conquest; let that give what dominion it will.  And 
if 1, or any body else, shall claim freedom, as derived from 
them, it will be very hard to prove the contrary: and it is 
plain, the law, that has made no distinction between the one and 
the other, intends not there should be any difference in their 
freedom or privileges.
     Sec. 178.  But supposing, which seldom happens, that the 
conquerors and conquered never incorporate into one people, under 
the same laws and freedom; let us see next what power a lawful 
conqueror has over the subdued: and that I say is purely 
despotical.  He has an absolute power over the lives of those who 
by an unjust war have forfeited them; but not over the lives or 
fortunes of those who engaged not in the war, nor over the 
possessions even of those who were actually engaged in it.
     Sec. 179.  Secondly, I say then the conqueror gets no power 
but only over those who have actually assisted, concurred, or 
consented to that unjust force that is used against him: for the 
people having given to their governors no power to do an unjust 
thing, such as is to make an unjust war, (for they never had such 
a power in themselves) they ought not to be charged as guilty of 
the violence and unjustice that is committed in an unjust war, 
any farther than they actually abet it; no more than they are to 
be thought guilty of any violence or oppression their governors 

should use upon the people themselves, or any part of their 
fellow subjects, they having empowered them no more to the one 
than to the other.  Conquerors, it is true, seldom trouble 
themselves to make the distinction, but they willingly permit the 
confusion of war to sweep all together: but yet this alters not 
the right; for the conquerors power over the lives of the 
conquered, being only because they have used force to do, or 
maintain an injustice, he can have that power only over those who 
have concurred in that force; all the rest are innocent; and he 
has no more title over the people of that country, who have done 
him no injury, and so have made no forfeiture of their lives, 
than he has over any other, who, without any injuries or 
provocations, have lived upon fair terms with him.
     Sec. 180.  Thirdly, The power a conqueror gets over those he 
overcomes in a just war, is perfectly despotical: he has an 
absolute power over the lives of those, who, by putting 
themselves in a state of war, have forfeited them; but he has not 
thereby a right and title to their possessions.  This I doubt 
not, but at first sight will seem a strange doctrine, it being so 
quite contrary to the practice of the world; there being nothing 
more familiar in speaking of the dominion of countries, than to 
say such an one conquered it; as if conquest, without any more 
ado, conveyed a right of possession.  But when we consider, that 
the practice of the strong and powerful, how universal soever it 
may be, is seldom the rule of right, however it be one part of 
the subjection of the conquered, not to argue against the 
conditions cut out to them by the conquering sword.
     Sec. 181.  Though in all war there be usually a complication 
of force and damage, and the aggressor seldom fails to harm the 
estate, when he uses force against the persons of those he makes 
war upon; yet it is the use of force only that puts a man into 
the state of war: for whether by force he begins the injury, or 
else having quietly, and by fraud, done the injury, he refuses to 
make reparation, and by force maintains it, (which is the same 
thing, as at first to have done it by force) it is the unjust use 
of force that makes the war: for he that breaks open my house, 
and violently turns me out of doors; or having peaceably got in, 
by force keeps me out, does in effect the same thing; supposing 
we are in such a state, that we have no common judge on earth, 
whom I may appeal to, and to whom we are both obliged to submit: 
for of such I am now speaking.  It is the unjust use of force 
then, that puts a man into the state of war with another; and 
thereby he that is guilty of it makes a forfeiture of his life: 
for quitting reason, which is the rule given between man and man, 
and using force, the way of beasts, he becomes liable to be 
destroyed by him he uses force against, as any savage ravenous 
beast, that is dangerous to his being.
     Sec. 182.  But because the miscarriages of the father are no 
faults of the children, and they may be rational and peaceable, 
notwithstanding the brutishness and injustice of the father; the 
father, by his miscarriages and violence, can forfeit but his own 
life, but involves not his children in his guilt or destruction.  
His goods, which nature, that willeth the preservation of all 
mankind as much as is possible, hath made to belong to the 
children to keep them from perishing, do still continue to belong 
to his children: for supposing them not to have joined in the 
war, either thro'infancy, absence, or choice, they have done 
nothing to forfeit them: nor has the conqueror any right to take 
them away, by the bare title of having subdued him that by force 
attempted his destruction; though perhaps he may have some right 
to them, to repair the damages he has sustained by the war, and 
the defence of his own right; which how far it reaches to the 
possessions of the conquered, we shall see by and by.  So that he 
that by conquest has a right over a man's person to destroy him 
if he pleases, has not thereby a right over his estate to possess 
and enjoy it: for it is the brutal force the aggressor has used, 

that gives his adversary a right to take away his life, and 
destroy him if he pleases, as a noxious creature; but it is 
damage sustained that alone gives him title to another man's 
goods: for though I may kill a thief that sets on me in the 
highway, yet I may not (which seems less) take away his money, 
and let him go: this would be robbery on my side.  His force, and 
the state of war he put himself in, made him forfeit his life, 
but gave me no title to his goods.  The right then of conquest 
extends only to the lives of those who joined in the war, not to 
their estates, but only in order to make reparation for the 
damages received, and the charges of the war, and that too with 
reservation of the right of the innocent wife and children.
     Sec. 183.  Let the conqueror have as much justice on his 
side, as could be supposed, he has no right to seize more than 
the vanquished could forfeit: his life is at the victor's mercy; 
and his service and goods he may appropriate, to make himself 
reparation; but he cannot take the goods of his wife and 
children; they too had a title to the goods he enjoyed, and their 
shares in the estate he possessed: for example, I in the state of 
nature (and all commonwealths are in the state of nature one with 
another) have injured another man, and refusing to give 
satisfaction, it comes to a state of war, wherein my defending by 
force what I had gotten unjustly, makes me the aggressor.  I am 
conquered: my life, it is true, as forfeit, is at mercy, but not 
my wife's and children's.  They made not the war, nor assisted in 
it.  I could not forfeit their lives; they were not mine to 
forfeit.  My wife had a share in my estate; that neither could I 
forfeit.  And my children also, being born of me, had a right to 
be maintained out of my labour or substance.  Here then is the 
case: the conqueror has a title to reparation for damages 
received, and the children have a title to their father's estate 
for their subsistence: for as to the wife's share, whether her 
own labour, or compact, gave her a title to it, it is plain, her 
husband could not forfeit what was her's.  What must be done in 
the case?  I answer; the fundamental law of nature being, that 
all, as much as may be, should be preserved, it follows, that if 
there be not enough fully to satisfy both, viz, for the 
conqueror's losses, and children's maintenance, he that hath, and 
to spare, must remit something of his full satisfaction, and give 
way to the pressing and preferable title of those who are in 
danger to perish without it.
     Sec. 184.  But supposing the charge and damages of the war 
are to be made up to the conqueror, to the utmost farthing; and 
that the children of the vanquished, spoiled of all their 
father's goods, are to be left to starve and perish; yet the 
satisfying of what shall, on this score, be due to the conqueror, 
will scarce give him a title to any country he shall conquer: for 
the damages of war can scarce amount to the value of any 
considerable tract of land, in any part of the world, where all 
the land is possessed, and none lies waste.  And if I have not 
taken away the conqueror's land, which, being vanquished, it is 
impossible I should; scarce any other spoil I have done him can 
amount to the value of mine, supposing it equally cultivated, and 
of an extent any way coming near what I had overrun of his.  The 
destruction of a year's product or two (for it seldom reaches 
four or five) is the utmost spoil that usually can be done: for 
as to money, and such riches and treasure taken away, these are 
none of nature's goods, they have but a fantastical imaginary 
value: nature has put no such upon them: they are of no more 
account by her standard, than the wampompeke of the Americans to 
an European prince, or the silver money of Europe would have been 
formerly to an American.  And five years product is not worth the 
perpetual inheritance of land, where all is possessed, and none 
remains waste, to be taken up by him that is disseized: which 
will be easily granted, if one do but take away the imaginary 
value of money, the disproportion being more than between five 

and five hundred; though, at the same time, half a year's product 
is more worth than the inheritance, where there being more land 
than the inhabitants possess and make use of, any one has liberty 
to make use of the waste: but there conquerors take little care 
to possess themselves of the lands of the vanquished, No damage 
therefore, that men in the state of nature (as all princes and 
governments are in reference to one another) suffer from one 
another, can give a conqueror power to dispossess the posterity 
of the vanquished, and turn them out of that inheritance, which 
ought to be the possession of them and their descendants to all 
generations.  The conqueror indeed will be apt to think himself 
master: and it is the very condition of the subdued not to be 
able to dispute their right.  But if that be all, it gives no 
other title than what bare force gives to the stronger over the 
weaker: and, by this reason, he that is strongest will have a 
right to whatever he pleases to seize on.
     Sec. 185.  Over those then that joined with him in the war, 
and over those of the subdued country that opposed him not, and 
the posterity even of those that did, the conqueror, even in a 
just war, hath, by his conquest, no right of dominion: they are 
free from any subjection to him, and if their former government 
be dissolved, they are at liberty to begin and erect another to 
themselves.
     Sec. 186.  The conqueror, it is true, usually, by the force 
he has over them, compels them, with a sword at their breasts, to 
stoop to his conditions, and submit to such a government as he 
pleases to afford them; but the enquiry is, what right he has to 
do so?  If it be said, they submit by their own consent, then 
this allows their own consent to be necessary to give the 
conqueror a title to rule over them.  It remains only to be 
considered, whether promises extorted by force, without right, 
can be thought consent, and how far they bind.  To which I shall 
say, they bind not at all; because whatsoever another gets from 
me by force, I still retain the right of, and he is obliged 
presently to restore.  He that forces my horse from me, ought 
presently to restore him, and I have still a right to retake him.   
By the same reason, he that forced a promise from me, ought 
presently to restore it, i.e.  quit me of the obligation of it; 
or I may resume it myself, i.e.  chuse whether I will perform it: 
for the law of nature laying an obligation on me only by the 
rules she prescribes, cannot oblige me by the violation of her 
rules: such is the extorting any thing from me by force.  Nor 
does it at all alter the case to say, I gave my promise, no more 
than it excuses the force, and passes the right, when I put my 
hand in my pocket, and deliver my purse myself to a thief, who 
demands it with a pistol at my breast.   
     Sec. 187.  From all which it follows, that the government of 
a conqueror, imposed by force on the subdued, against whom he had 
no right of war, or who joined not in the war against him, where 
he had right, has no obligation upon them.
     Sec. 188.  But let us suppose, that all the men of that 
community, being all members of the same body politic, may be 
taken to have joined in that unjust war wherein they are subdued, 
and so their lives are at the mercy of the conqueror.
     Sec. 189.  1 say, this concerns not their children who are 
in their minority: for since a father hath not, in himself, a 
power over the life or liberty of his child, no act of his can 
possibly forfeit it.  So that the children, whatever may have 
happened to the fathers, are freemen, and the absolute power of 
the conqueror reaches no farther than the persons of the men that 
were subdued by him, and dies with them: and should he govern 
them as slaves, subjected to his absolute arbitrary power, he has 
no such right of dominion over their children.  He can have no 
power over them but by their own consent, whatever he may drive 
them to say or do; and he has no lawfull authority, whilst force, 
and not choice, compels them to submission.

     Sec. 190.  Every man is born with a double right: first, a 
right of freedom to his person, which no other man has a power 
over, but the free disposal of it lies in himself.  Secondly, a 
right, before any other man, to inherit with his brethren his 
father's goods.
     Sec. 191.  By the first of these, a man is naturally free 
from subjection to any government, tho' he be born in a place 
under its jurisdiction; but if he disclaim the lawful government 
of the country he was born in, he must also quit the right that 
belonged to him by the laws of it, and the possessions there 
descending to him from his ancestors, if it were a government 
made by their consent.
     Sec. 192.  By the second, the inhabitants of any country, 
who are descended, and derive a title to their estates from those 
who are subdued, and had a government forced upon them against 
their free consents, retain a right to the possession of their 
ancestors, though they consent not freely to the government, 
whose hard conditions were by force imposed on the possessors of 
that country: for the first conqueror never having had a title to 
the land of that country, the people who are the descendants of, 
or claim under those who were forced to submit to the yoke of a 
government by constraint, have always a right to shake it off, 
and free themselves from the usurpation or tyranny which the 
sword hath brought in upon them, till their rulers put them under 
such a frame of government as they willingly and of choice 
consent to.  Who doubts but the Grecian Christians, descendants 
of the ancient possessors of that country, may justly cast off 
the Turkish yoke, which they have so long groaned under, whenever 
they have an opportunity to do it?  For no government can have a 
right to obedience from a people who have not freely consented to 
it; which they can never be supposed to do, till either they are 
put in a full state of liberty to chuse their government and 
governors, or at least till they have such standing laws, to 
which they have by themselves or their representatives given 
their free consent, and also till they are allowed their due 
property, which is so to be proprietors of what they have, that 
no body can take away any part of it without their own consent, 
without which, men under any government are not in the state of 
freemen, but are direct slaves under the force of war.
     Sec. 193.  But granting that the conqueror in a just war has 
a right to the estates, as well as power over the persons, of the 
conquered; which, it is plain, he hath not: nothing of absolute 
power will follow from hence, in the continuance of the 
government; because the descendants of these being all freemen, 
if he grants them estates and possessions to inhabit his country, 
(without which it would be worth nothing) whatsoever he grants 
them, they have, so far as it is granted, property in.  The 
nature whereof is, that without a man's own consent it cannot be 
taken from him,
     Sec. 194.  Their persons are free by a native right, and 
their properties, be they more or less, are their own, and at 
their own dispose, and not at his; or else it is no property.  
Supposing the conqueror gives to one man a thousand acres, to him 
and his heirs for ever; to another he lets a thousand acres for 
his life, under the rent of 501.  or 5001.  per arm.  has not the 
one of these a right to his thousand acres for ever, and the 
other, during his life, paying the said rent? and hath not the 
tenant for life a property in all that he gets over and above his 
rent, by his labour and industry during the said term, supposing 
it be double the rent?  Can any one say, the king, or conqueror, 
after his grant, may by his power of conqueror take away all, or 
part of the land from the heirs of one, or from the other during 
his life, he paying the rent? or can he take away from either the 
goods or money they have got upon the said land, at his pleasure?  
If he can, then all free and voluntary contracts cease, and are 
void in the world; there needs nothing to dissolve them at any 

time, but power enough: and all the grants and promises of men in 
power are but mockery and collusion: for can there be any thing 
more ridiculous than to say, I give you and your's this for ever, 
and that in the surest and most solemn way of conveyance can be 
devised; and yet it is to be understood, that I have right, if I 
please, to take it away from you again to morrow?
     Sec. 195.  1 will not dispute now whether princes are exempt 
from the laws of their country; but this I am sure, they owe 
subjection to the laws of God and nature.  No body, no power, can 
exempt them from the obligations of that eternal law.  Those are 
so great, and so strong, in the case of promises, that 
omnipotency itself can be tied by them.  Grants, promises, and 
oaths, are bonds that hold the Almighty: whatever some flatterers 
say to princes of the world, who all together, with all their 
people joined to them, are, in comparison of the great God, but 
as a drop of the bucket, or a dust on the balance, 
inconsiderable, nothing!
     Sec. 196.  The short of the case in conquest is this: the 
conqueror, if he have a just cause, has a despotical right over 
the persons of all, that actually aided, and concurred in the war 
against him, and a right to make up his damage and cost out of 
their labour and estates, so he injure not the right of any 
other.  Over the rest of the people, if there were any that 
consented not to the war, and over the children of the captives 
themselves, or the possessions of either, he has no power; and so 
can have, by virtue of conquest, no lawful title himself to 
dominion over them, or derive it to his posterity; but is an 
aggressor, if he attempts upon their properties, and thereby puts 
himself in a state of war against them, and has no better a right 
of principality, he, nor any of his successors, than Hingar, or 
Hubba, the Danes, had here in England; or Spartacus, had he 
conquered Italy, would have had; which is to have their yoke cast 
off, as soon as God shall give those under their subjection 
courage and opportunity to do it.  Thus, notwithstanding whatever 
title the kings of Assyria had over Judah, by the sword, God 
assisted Hezekiah to throw off the dominion of that conquering 
empire.  And the lord was with Hezekiah, and he prospered; 
wherefore he went forth, and he rebelled against the king of 
Assyria, and served him not, 2 Kings xviii.  7.  Whence it is 
plain, that shaking off a power, which force, and not right, hath 
set over any one, though it hath the name of rebellion, yet is no 
offence before God, but is that which he allows and countenances, 
though even promises and covenants, when obtained by force, have 
intervened: for it is very probable, to any one that reads the 
story of Ahaz and Hezekiah attentively, that the Assyrians 
subdued Ahaz, and deposed him, and made Hezekiah king in his 
father's lifetime; and that Hezekiah by agreement had done him 
homage, and paid him tribute all this time.

                     Of USURPATION.

     Sec. 197.  AS conquest may be called a foreign usurpation, 
so usurpation is a kind of domestic conquest, with this 
difference, that an usurper can never have right on his side, it 
being no usurpation, but where one is got into the possession of 
what another has right to.   This, so far as it is usurpation, is 
a change only of persons, but not of the forms and rules of the 
government: for if the usurper extend his power beyond what of 
right belonged to the lawful princes, or governors of the 
commonwealth, it is tyranny added to usurpation.
     Sec. 198.  In all lawful governments, the designation of the 
persons, who are to bear rule, is as natural and necessary a part 

as the form of the government itself, and is that which had its 
establishment originally from the people; the anarchy being much 
alike, to have no form of government at all; or to agree, that it 
shall be monarchical, but to appoint no way to design the person 
that shall have the power, and be the monarch.  Hence all 
commonwealths, with the form of government established, have 
rules also of appointing those who are to have any share in the 
public authority, and settled methods of conveying the right to 
them: for the anarchy is much alike, to have no form of 
government at all; or to agree that it shall be monarchical, but 
to appoint no way to know or design the person that shall have 
the power, and be the monarch.  Whoever gets into the exercise of 
any part of the power, by other ways than what the laws of the 
community have prescribed, hath no right to be obeyed, though the 
form of the commonwealth be still preserved; since he is not the 
person the laws have appointed, and consequently not the person 
the people have consented to.  Nor can such an usurper, or any 
deriving from him, ever have a title, till the people are both at 
liberty to consent, and have actually consented to allow, and 
confirm in him the power he hath till then usurped.



                     CHAP.  XVIII.

                      Of TYRANNY.

     Sec. 199.  AS usurpation is the exercise of power, which 
another hath a right to; so tyranny is the exercise of power 
beyond right, which no body can have a right to.  And this is 
making use of the power any one has in his hands, not for the 
good of those who are under it, but for his own private separate 
advantage.  When the governor, however intitled, makes not the 
law, but his will, the rule; and his commands and actions are not 
directed to the preservation of the properties of his people, but 
the satisfaction of his own ambition, revenge, covetousness, or 
any other irregular passion.
     Sec. 200.  If one can doubt this to be truth, or reason, 
because it comes from the obscure hand of a subject, I hope the 
authority of a king will make it pass with him.  King James the 
first, in his speech to the parliament, 1603, tells them thus, I 
will ever prefer the weal of the public, and of the whole 
commonwealth, in making of good laws and constitutions, to any 
particular and private ends of mine; thinking ever the wealth and 
weal of the commonwealth to be my greatest weal and worldly 
felicity; a point wherein a lawful king doth directly differ from 
a tyrant: for I do acknowledge, that the special and greatest 
point of difference that is between a rightful king and an 
usurping tyrant, is this, that whereas the proud and ambitious 
tyrant doth think his kingdom and people are only ordained for 
satisfaction of his desires and unreasonable appetites, the 
righteous and just king doth by the contrary acknowledge himself 
to be ordained for the procuring of the wealth and property of 
his people, And again, in his speech to the parliament, 1609, he 
hath these words, The king binds himself by a double oath, to the 
observation of the fundamental laws of his kingdom; tacitly, as 
by being a king, and so bound to protect as well the people, as 
the laws of his kingdom; and expressly, by his oath at his 
coronation, so as every just king, in a settled kingdom, is bound 
to observe that paction made to his people, by his laws, in 
framing his government agreeable thereunto, according to that 
paction which God made with Noah after the deluge.  Hereafter, 
seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, 
and day and night, shall not cease while the earth remaineth.  
And therefore a king governing in a settled kingdom, leaves to be 
a king, and degenerates into a tyrant, as soon as he leaves off 

to rule according to his laws, And a little after, Therefore all 
kings that are not tyrants, or perjured, will be glad to bound 
themselves within the limits of their laws; and they that 
persuade them the contrary, are vipers, and pests both against 
them and the commonwealth.  Thus that learned king, who well 
understood the notion of things, makes the difference betwixt a 
king and a tyrant to consist only in this, that one makes the 
laws the bounds of his power, and the good of the public, the end 
of his government; the other makes all give way to his own will 
and appetite.
     Sec. 201.  It is a mistake, to think this fault is proper 
only to monarchies; other forms of government are liable to it, 
as well as that: for wherever the power, that is put in any hands 
for the government of the people, and the preservation of their 
properties, is applied to other ends, and made use of to 
impoverish, harass, or subdue them to the arbitrary and irregular 
commands of those that have it; there it presently becomes 
tyranny, whether those that thus use it are one or many.  Thus we 
read of the thirty tyrants at Athens, as well as one at Syracuse; 
and the intolerable dominion of the Decemviri  at Rome was 
nothing better.
     Sec. 202.  Where-ever law ends, tyranny begins, if the law 
be transgressed to another's harm; and whosoever in authority 
exceeds the power given him by the law, and makes use of the 
force he has under his command, to compass that upon the subject, 
which the law allows not, ceases in that to be a magistrate; and, 
acting without authority, may be opposed, as any other man, who 
by force invades the right of another.  This is acknowledged in 
subordinate magistrates.  He that hath authority to seize my 
person in the street, may be opposed as a thief and a robber, if 
he endeavours to break into my house to execute a writ, 
notwithstanding that I know he has such a warrant, and such a 
legal authority, as will impower him to arrest me abroad.  And 
why this should not hold in the highest, as well as in the most 
inferior magistrate, I would gladly be informed.  Is it 
reasonable, that the eldest brother, because he has the greatest 
part of his father's estate, should thereby have a right to take 
away any of his younger brothers portions? or that a rich man, 
who possessed a whole country, should from thence have a right to 
seize, when he pleased, the cottage and garden of his poor 
neighbour?  The being rightfully possessed of great power and 
riches, exceedingly beyond the greatest part of the sons of Adam, 
is so far from being an excuse, much less a reason, for rapine 
and oppression, which the endamaging another without authority 
is, that it is a great aggravation of it: for the exceeding the 
bounds of authority is no more a right in a great, than in a 
petty officer; no more justifiable in a king than a constable; 
but is so much the worse in him, in that he has more trust put in 
him, has already a much greater share than the rest of his 
brethren, and is supposed, from the advantages of his education, 
employment, and counsellors, to be more knowing in the measures 
of right and wrong.
     Sec. 203.  May the commands then of a prince be opposed? may 
he be resisted as often as any one shall find himself aggrieved, 
and but imagine he has not right done him?  This will unhinge and 
overturn all polities, and, instead of government and order, 
leave nothing but anarchy and confusion.
     Sec. 204.  To this I answer, that force is to be opposed to 
nothing, but to unjust and unlawful force; whoever makes any 
opposition in any other case, draws on himself a just 
condemnation both from God and man; and so no such danger or 
confusion will follow, as is often suggested: for,
     Sec. 205.  First, As, in some countries, the person of the 
prince by the law is sacred; and so, whatever he commands or 
does, his person is still free from all question or violence, not 
liable to force, or any judicial censure or condemnation.  But 

yet opposition may be made to the illegal acts of any inferior 
officer, or other commissioned by him; unless he will, by 
actually putting himself into a state of war with his people, 
dissolve the government, and leave them to that defence which 
belongs to every one in the state of nature: for of such things 
who can tell what the end will be? and a neighbour kingdom has 
shewed the world an odd example.  In all other cases the 
sacredness of the person exempts him from all inconveniencies, 
whereby he is secure, whilst the government stands, from all 
violence and harm whatsoever; than which there cannot be a wiser 
constitution: for the harm he can do in his own person not being 
likely to happen often, nor to extend itself far; nor being able 
by his single strength to subvert the laws, nor oppress the body 
of the people, should any prince have so much weakness, and ill 
nature as to be willing to do it, the inconveniency of some 
particular mischiefs, that may happen sometimes, when a heady 
prince comes to the throne, are well recompensed by the peace of 
the public, and security of the government, in the person of the 
chief magistrate, thus set out of the reach of danger: it being 
safer for the body, that some few private men should be sometimes 
in danger to suffer, than that the head of the republic should be 
easily, and upon slight occasions, exposed.
     Sec. 206.  Secondly, But this privilege, belonging only to 
the king's person, hinders not, but they may be questioned, 
opposed, and resisted, who use unjust force, though they pretend 
a commission from him, which the law authorizes not; as is plain 
in the case of him that has the king's writ to arrest a man, 
which is a full commission from the king; and yet he that has it 
cannot break open a man's house to do it, nor execute this 
command of the king upon certain days, nor in certain places, 
though this commission have no such exception in it; but they are 
the limitations of the law, which if any one transgress, the 
king's commission excuses him not: for the king's authority being 
given him only by the law, he cannot impower any one to act 
against the law, or justify him, by his commission, in so doing; 
the commission, or command of any magistrate, where he has no 
authority, being as void and insignificant, as that of any 
private man; the difference between the one and the other, being 
that the magistrate has some authority so far, and to such ends, 
and the private man has none at all: for it is not the 
commission, but the authority, that gives the right of acting; 
and against the laws there can be no authority.  But, 
notwithstanding such resistance, the king's person and authority 
are still both secured, and so no danger to governor or 
government,
     Sec. 207.  Thirdly, Supposing a government wherein the 
person of the chief magistrate is not thus sacred; yet this 
doctrine of the lawfulness of resisting all unlawful exercises of 
his power, will not upon every slight occasion indanger him, or 
imbroil the government: for where the injured party may be 
relieved, and his damages repaired by appeal to the law, there 
can be no pretence for force, which is only to be used where a 
man is intercepted from appealing to the law: for nothing is to 
be accounted hostile force, but where it leaves not the remedy of 
such an appeal; and it is such force alone, that puts him that 
uses it into a state of war, and makes it lawful to resist him.  
A man with a sword in his hand demands my purse in the high-way, 
when perhaps I have not twelve pence in my pocket: this man I may 
lawfully kill.  To another I deliver lool.  to hold only whilst I 
alight, which he refuses to restore me, when I am got up again, 
but draws his sword to defend the possession of it by force, if I 
endeavour to retake it.  The mischief this man does me is a 
hundred, or possibly a thousand times more than the other perhaps 
intended me (whom I killed before he really did me any); and yet 
I might lawfully kill the one, and cannot so much as hurt the 
other lawfully.  The reason whereof is plain; because the one 

using force, which threatened my life, I could not have time to 
appeal to the law to secure it: and when it was gone, it was too 
late to appeal.  The law could not restore life to my dead 
carcass: the loss was irreparable; which to prevent, the law of 
nature gave me a right to destroy him, who had put himself into a 
state of war with me, and threatened my destruction.  But in the 
other case, my life not being in danger, I may have the benefit 
of appealing to the law, and have reparation for my lool.  that 
way.
     Sec. 208.  Fourthly, But if the unlawful acts done by the 
magistrate be maintained (by the power he has got), and the 
remedy which is due by law, be by the same power obstructed; yet 
the right of resisting, even in such manifest acts of tyranny, 
will not suddenly, or on slight occasions, disturb the 
government: for if it reach no farther than some private men's 
cases, though they have a right to defend themselves, and to 
recover by force what by unlawful force is taken from them; yet 
the right to do so will not easily engage them in a contest, 
wherein they are sure to perish; it being as impossible for one, 
or a few oppressed men to disturb the government, where the body 
of the people do not think themselves concerned in it, as for a 
raving mad-man, or heady malcontent to overturn a well settled 
state; the people being as little apt to follow the one, as the 
other.
     Sec. 209.  But if either these illegal acts have extended to 
the majority of the people; or if the mischief and oppression has 
lighted only on some few, but in such cases, as the precedent, 
and consequences seem to threaten all; and they are persuaded in 
their consciences, that their laws, and with them their estates, 
liberties, and lives are in danger, and perhaps their religion 
too; how they will be hindered from resisting illegal force, used 
against them, I cannot tell.  This is an inconvenience, I 
confess, that attends all governments whatsoever, when the 
governors have brought it to this pass, to be generally suspected 
of their people; the most dangerous state which they can possibly 
put themselves in.  wherein they are the less to be pitied, 
because it is so easy to be avoided; it being as impossible for a 
governor, if he really means the good of his people, and the 
preservation of them, and their laws together, not to make them 
see and feel it, as it is for the father of a family, not to let 
his children see he loves, and takes care of them.
     Sec. 210.  But if all the world shall observe pretences of 
one kind, and actions of another; arts used to elude the law, and 
the trust of prerogative (which is an arbitrary power in some 
things left in the prince's hand to do good, not harm to the 
people) employed contrary to the end for which it was given: if 
the people shall find the ministers and subordinate magistrates 
chosen suitable to such ends, and favoured, or laid by, 
proportionably as they promote or oppose them: if they see 
several experiments made of arbitrary power, and that religion 
underhand favoured, (tho' publicly proclaimed against) which is 
readiest to introduce it; and the operators in it supported, as 
much as may be; and when that cannot be done, yet approved still, 
and liked the better: if a long train of actions shew the 
councils all tending that way; how can a man any more hinder 
himself from being persuaded in his own mind, which way things 
are going; or from casting about how to save himself, than he 
could from believing the captain of the ship he was in, was 
carrying him, and the rest of the company, to Algiers, when he 
found him always steering that course, though cross winds, leaks 
in his ship, and want of men and provisions did often force him 
to turn his course another way for some time, which he steadily 
returned to again, as soon as the wind, weather, and other 
circumstances would let him?




                       CHAP.  XIX.

           Of the Dissolution of Government.

     Sec. 211.  HE that will with any clearness speak of the 
dissolution of government, ought in the first place to 
distinguish between the dissolution of the society and the 
dissolution of the government.   That which makes the community, 
and brings men out of the loose state of nature, into one politic 
society, is the agreement which every one has with the rest to 
incorporate, and act as one body, and so be one distinct common-
wealth.  The usual, and almost only way whereby this union is 
dissolved, is the inroad of foreign force mak
ing a conquest upon them: for in that case, (not being able to 
maintain and support themselves, as one intire and independent 
body) the union belonging to that body which consisted therein, 
must necessarily cease, and so every one return to the state he 
was in before, with a liberty to shift for himself, and provide 
for his own safety, as he thinks fit, in some other society.  
Whenever the society is dissolved, it is certain the government 
of that society cannot remain.  Thus conquerors swords often cut 
up governments by the roots, and mangle societies to pieces, 
separating the subdued or scattered multitude from the protection 
of, and dependence on, that society which ought to have preserved 
them from violence.  The world is too well instructed in, and too 
forward to allow of, this way of dissolving of governments, to 
need any more to be said of it; and there wants not much argument 
to prove, that where the society is dissolved, the government 
cannot remain; that being as impossible, as for the frame of an 
house to subsist when the materials of it are scattered and 
dissipated by a whirl-wind, or jumbled into a confused heap by an 
earthquake.
     Sec. 212.  Besides this over-turning from without, 
governments are dissolved from within,
     First, When the legislative is altered.  Civil society being 
a state of peace, amongst those who are of it, from whom the 
state of war is excluded by the umpirage, which they have 
provided in their legislative, for the ending all differences 
that may arise amongst any of them, it is in their legislative, 
that the members of a commonwealth are united, and combined 
together into one coherent living body.  This is the soul that 
gives form, life, and unity, to the common-wealth: from hence the 
several members have their mutual influence, sympathy, and 
connexion: and therefore, when the legislative is broken, or 
dissolved, dissolution and death follows: for the essence and 
union of the society consisting in having one will, the 
legislative, when once established by the majority, has the 
declaring, and as it were keeping of that will.  The constitution 
of the legislative is the first and fundamental act of society, 
whereby provision is made for the continuation of their union, 
under the direction of persons, and bonds of laws, made by 
persons authorized thereunto, by the consent and appointment of 
the people, without which no one man, or number of men, amongst 
them, can have authority of making laws that shall be binding to 
the rest.   When any one, or more, shall take upon them to make 
laws, whom the people have not appointed so to do, they make laws 
without authority, which the people are not therefore bound to 
obey; by which means they come again to be out of subjection, and 
may constitute to themselves a new legislative, as they think 
best, being in full liberty to resist the force of those, who 
without authority would impose any thing upon them.  Every one is 
at the disposure of his own will, when those who had, by the 
delegation of the society, the declaring of the public will, are 
excluded from it, and others usurp the place, who have no such 
authority or delegation.

     Sec. 213.  This being usually brought about by such in the 
commonwealth who misuse the power they have; it is hard to 
consider it aright, and know at whose door to lay it, without 
knowing the form of government in which it happens.  Let us 
suppose then the legislative placed in the concurrence of three 
distinct persons.
     1.  A single hereditary person, having the constant, 
supreme, executive power, and with it the power of convoking and 
dissolving the other two within certain periods of time.
     2.  An assembly of hereditary nobility.
     3.  An assembly of representatives chosen, pro tempore, by 
the people.  Such a form of government supposed, it is evident,
     Sec. 214.  First, That when such a single person, or prince, 
sets up his own arbitrary will in place of the laws, which are 
the will of the society, declarad by the legislative, then the 
legislative is changed: for that being in effect the legislative, 
whose rules and laws are put in execution, and required to be 
obeyed; when other laws are set up, and other rules pretended, 
and inforced, than what the legislative, constituted by the 
society, have enacted, it is plain that the legislative is 
changed.  Whoever introduces new laws, not being thereunto 
authorized by the fundamental appointment of the society, or 
subverts the old, disowns and overturns the power by which they 
were made, and so sets up a new legislative.
     Sec. 215.  Secondly, When the prince hinders the legislative 
from assembling in its due time, or from acting freely, pursuant 
to those ends for which it was constituted, the legislative is 
altered: for it is not a certain number of men, no, nor their 
meeting, unless they have also freedom of debating, and leisure 
of perfecting, what is for the good of the society, wherein the 
legislative consists: when these are taken away or altered, so as 
to deprive the society of the due exercise of their power, the 
legislative is truly altered; for it is not names that constitute 
governments, but the use and exercise of those powers that were 
intended to accompany them; so that he, who takes away the 
freedom, or hinders the acting of the legislative in its due 
seasons, in effect takes away the legislative, and puts an end to 
the government,
     Sec. 216.  Thirdly, When, by the arbitrary power of the 
prince, the electors, or ways of election, are altered, without 
the consent, and contrary to the common interest of the people, 
there also the legislative is altered: for, if others than those 
whom the society hath authorized thereunto, do chuse, or in 
another way than what the society hath prescribed, those chosen 
are not the legislative appointed by the people.
     Sec. 217.  Fourthly, The delivery also of the people into 
the subjection of a foreign power, either by the prince, or by 
the legislative, is certainly a change of the legislative, and so 
a dissolution of the government: for the end why people entered 
into society being to be preserved one intire, free, independent 
society, to be governed by its own laws; this is lost, whenever 
they are given up into the power of another.
     Sec. 218.  Why, in such a constitution as this, the 
dissolution of the government in these cases is to be imputed to 
the prince, is evident; because he, having the force, treasure 
and offices of the state to employ, and often persuading himself, 
or being flattered by others, that as supreme magistrate he is 
uncapable of controul; he alone is in a condition to make great 
advances toward such changes, under pretence of lawful authority, 
and has it in his hands to terrify or suppress opposers, as 
factious, seditious, and enemies to the government: whereas no 
other part of the legislative, or people, is capable by 
themselves to attempt any alteration of the legislative, without 
open and visible rebellion, apt enough to be taken notice of, 
which, when it prevails, produces effects very little different 
from foreign conquest.  Besides, the prince in such a form of 

government, having the power of dissolving the other parts of the 
legislative, and thereby rendering them private persons, they can 
never in opposition to him, or without his concurrence, alter the 
legislative by a law, his conse power, neglects and abandons that charge, so that the 
laws already made can no longer be put in execution.  This is 
demonstratively to reduce all to anarchy, and so effectually to 
dissolve the government: for laws not being made for themselves, 
but to be, by their execution, the bonds of the society, to keep 
every part of the body politic in its due place and function; 
when that totally ceases, the government visibly ceases, and the 
people become a confused multitude, without order or connexion.  
Where there is no longer the administration of justice, for the 
securing of men's rights, nor any remaining power within the 
community to direct the force, or provide for the necessities of 
the public, there certainly is no government left.  Where the 
laws cannot be executed, it is all one as if there were no laws; 
and a government without laws is, I suppose, a mystery in 
politics, unconceivable to human capacity, and inconsistent with 
human society.
     Sec. 220.  In these and the like cases, when the government 
is dissolved, the people are at liberty to provide for 
themselves, by erecting a new legislative, differing from the 
other, by the change of persons, or form, or both, as they shall 
find it most for their safety and good: for the society can 
never, by the fault of another, lose the native and original 
right it has to preserve itself, which can only be done by a 
settled legislative, and a fair and impartial execution of the 
laws made by it.  But the state of mankind is not so miserable 
that they are not capable of using this remedy, till it be too 
late to look for any.  To tell people they may provide for 
themselves, by erecting a new legislative, when by oppression, 
artifice, or being delivered over to a foreign power, their old 
one is gone, is only to tell them, they may expect relief when it 
is too late, and the evil is past cure.  This is in effect no 
more than to bid them first be slaves, and then to take care of 
their liberty; and when their chains are on, tell them, they may 
act like freemen.  This, if barely so, is rather mockery than 
relief; and men can never be secure from tyranny, if there be no 
means to escape it till they are perfectly under it: and 
therefore it is, that they have not only a right to get out of 
it, but to prevent it.
     Sec. 221.  There is therefore, secondly, another way whereby 
governments are dissolved, and that is, when the legislative, or 
the prince, either of them, act contrary to their trust.    
First, The legislative acts against the trust reposed in them, 
when they endeavour to invade the property of the subject, and to 
make themselves, or any part of the community, masters, or 
arbitrary disposers of the lives, liberties, or fortunes of the 
people.
     Sec. 222.  The reason why men enter into society, is the 
preservation of their property; and the end why they chuse and 
authorize a legislative, is, that there may be laws made, and 
rules set, as guards and fences to the properties of all the 
members of the society, to limit the power, and moderate the 
dominion, of every part and member of the society: for since it 
can never be supposed to be the will of the society, that the 
legislative should have a power to destroy that which every one 
designs to secure, by entering into society, and for which the 
people submitted themselves to legislators of their own making; 
whenever the legislators endeavour to take away, and destroy the 
property of the people, or to reduce them to slavery under 
arbitrary power, they put themselves into a state of war with the 
people, who are thereupon absolved from any farther obedience, 
and are left to the common refuge, which God hath provided for 
all men, against force and violence.  Whensoever therefore the 
legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; 

and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavour to 
grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute 
power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by 
this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put 
into their hands for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the 
people, who.  have a right to resume their original liberty, and, 
by the establishment of a new legislative, (such as they shall 
think fit) provide for their own safety and security, which is 
the end for which they are in society.  What I have said here, 
concerning the legislative in general, holds true also concerning 
the supreme executor, who having a double trust put in him, both 
to have a part in the legislative, and the supreme execution of 
the law, acts against both, when he goes about to set up his own 
arbitrary will as the law of the society.  He acts also contrary 
to his trust, when he either employs the force, treasure, and 
offices of the society, to corrupt the representatives, and gain 
them to his purposes; or openly preengages the electors, and 
prescribes to their choice, such, whom he has, by sollicitations, 
threats, promises, or otherwise, won to his designs; and employs 
them to bring in such, who have promised before-hand what to 
vote, and what to enact.  Thus to regulate candidates and 
electors, and new-model the ways of election, what is it but to 
cut up the government by the roots, and poison the very fountain 
of public security? for the people having reserved to themselves 
the choice of their representatives, as the fence to their 
properties, could do it for no other end, but that they might 
always be freely chosen, and so chosen, freely act, and advise, 
as the necessity of the common-wealth, and the public good 
should, upon examination, and mature debate, be judged to 
require.  This, those who give their votes before they hear the 
debate, and have weighed the reasons on all sides, are not 
capable of doing.  To prepare such an assembly as this, and 
endeavour to set up the declared abettors of his own will, for 
the true representatives of the people, and the law-makers of the 
society, is certainly as great a breach of trust, and as perfect 
a declaration of a design to subvert the government, as is 
possible to be met with.  To which, if one shall add rewards and 
punishments visibly employed to the same end, and all the arts of 
perverted law made use of, to take off and destroy all that stand 
in the way of such a design, and will not comply and consent to 
betray the liberties of their country, it will be past doubt what 
is doing.  What power they ought to have in the society, who thus 
employ it contrary to the trust went along with it in its first 
institution, is easy to determine; and one cannot but see, that 
he, who has once attempted any such thing as this, cannot any 
longer be trusted.
     Sec. 223.  To this perhaps it will be said, that the people 
being ignorant, and always discontented, to lay the foundation of 
government in the unsteady opinion and uncertain humour of the 
people, is to expose it to certain ruin; and no government will 
be able long to subsist, if the people may set up a new 
legislative, whenever they take offence at the old one.  To this 
I answer, Quite the contrary.   People are not so easily got out 
of their old forms, as some are apt to suggest.  They are hardly 
to be prevailed with to amend the acknowledged faults in the 
frame they have been accustomed to.   And if there be any 
original defects, or adventitious ones introduced by time, or 
corruption; it is not an easy thing to get them changed, even 
when all the world sees there is an opportunity for it.  This 
slowness and aversion in the people to quit their old 
constitutions, has, in the many revolutions which have been seen 
in this kingdom, in this and former ages, still kept us to, or, 
after some interval of fruitless attempts, still brought us back 
again to our old legislative of king, lords and commons: and 
whatever provocations have made the crown be taken from some of 
our princes heads, they never carried the people so far as to 

place it in another line.
     Sec. 224.  But it will be said, this hypothesis lays a 
ferment for frequent rebellion.  To which I answer,
     First, No more than any other hypothesis: for when the 
people are made miserable, and find themselves exposed to the ill 
usage of arbitrary power, cry up their governors, as much as you 
will, for sons of Jupiter; let them be sacred and divine, 
descended, or authorized from heaven; give them out for whom or 
what you please, the same will happen.  The people generally ill 
treated, and contrary to right, will be ready upon any occasion 
to ease themselves of a burden that sits heavy upon them.  They 
will wish, and seek for the opportunity, which in the change, 
weakness and accidents of human affairs, seldom delays long to 
offer itself.  He must have lived but a little while in the 
world, who has not seen examples of this in his time; and he must 
have read very little, who cannot produce examples of it in all 
sorts of governments in the world.
     Sec. 225.  Secondly, I answer, such revolutions happen not 
upon every little mismanagement in public affairs.  Great 
mistakes in the ruling part, many wrong and inconvenient laws, 
and all the slips of human frailty, will be born by the people 
without mutiny or murmur.  But if a long train of abuses, 
prevarications and artifices, all tending the same way, make the 
design visible to the people, and they cannot but feel what they 
lie under, and see whither they are going; it is not to be 
wondered, that they should then rouze themselves, and endeavour 
to put the rule into such hands which may secure to them the ends 
for which government was at first erected; and without which, 
ancient names, and specious forms, are so far from being better, 
that they are much worse, than the state of nature, or pure 
anarchy; the inconveniencies being all as great and as near, but 
the remedy farther off and more difficult.
     Sec. 226.  Thirdly, I answer, that this doctrine of a power 
in the people of providing for their safety a-new, by a new 
legislative, when their legislators have acted contrary to their 
trust, by invading their property, is the best fence against 
rebellion, and the probablest means to hinder it: for rebellion 
being an opposition, not to persons, but authority, which is 
founded only in the constitutions and laws of the government; 
those, whoever they be, who by force break through, and by force 
justify their violation of them, are truly and properly rebels: 
for when men, by entering into society and civil-government, have 
excluded force, and introduced laws for the preservation of 
property, peace, and unity amongst themselves, those who set up 
force again in opposition to the laws, do rebellare, that is, 
bring back again the state of war, and are properly rebels: which 
they who are in power, (by the pretence they have to authority, 
the temptation of force they have in their hands, and the 
flattery of those about them) being likeliest to do; the 
properest way to prevent the evil, is to shew them the danger and 
injustice of it, who are under the greatest temptation to run 
into it.
     Sec. 227.  In both the fore-mentioned cases, when either the 
legislative is changed, or the legislators act contrary to the 
end for which they were constituted; those who are guilty are 
guilty of rebellion: for if any one by force takes away the 
established legislative of any society, and the laws by them 
made, pursuant to their trust, he thereby takes away the 
umpirage, which every one had consented to, for a peaceable 
decision of all their controversies, and a bar to the state of 
war amongst them.  They, who remove, or change the legislative, 
take away this decisive power, which no body can have, but by the 
appointment and consent of the people; and so destroying the 
authority which the people did, and no body else can set up, and 
introducing a power which the people hath not authorized, they 
actually introduce a state of war, which is that of force without 

authority: and thus, by removing the legislative established by 
the society, (in whose decisions the people acquiesced and 
united, as to that of their own will) they untie the knot, and 
expose the people a-new to the state of war, And if those, who by 
force take away the legislative, are rebels, the legislators 
themselves, as has been shewn, can be no less esteemed so; when 
they, who were set up for the protection, and preservation of the 
people, their liberties and properties, shall by force invade and 
endeavour to take them away; and so they putting themselves into 
a state of war with those who made them the protectors and 
guardians of their peace, are properly, and with the greatest 
aggravation, rebellantes, rebels.
     Sec. 228.  But if they, who say it lays a foundation for 
rebellion, mean that it may occasion civil wars, or intestine 
broils, to tell the people they are absolved from obedience when 
illegal attempts are made upon their liberties or properties, and 
may oppose the unlawful violence of those who were their 
magistrates, when they invade their properties contrary to the 
trust put in them; and that therefore this doctrine is not to be 
allowed, being so destructive to the peace of the world: they may 
as well say, upon the same ground, that honest men may not oppose 
robbers or pirates, because this may occasion disorder or 
bloodshed.  If any mischief come in such cases, it is not to be 
charged upon him who defends his own right, but on him that 
invades his neighbours.  If the innocent honest man must quietly 
quit all he has, for peace sake, to him who will lay violent 
hands upon it, I desire it may be considered, what a kind of 
peace there will be in the world, which consists only in violence 
and rapine; and which is to be maintained only for the benefit of 
robbers and oppressors.  VVho would not think it an admirable 
peace betwix the mighty and the mean, when the lamb, without 
resistance, yielded his throat to be torn by the imperious wolf?  
Polyphemus's den gives us a perfect pattern of such a peace, and 
such a government, wherein Ulysses and his companions had nothing 
to do, but quietly to suffer themselves to be devoured.  And no 
doubt Ulysses, who was a prudent man, preached up passive 
obedience, and exhorted them to a quiet submission, by 
representing to them of what concernment peace was to mankind; 
and by shewing the inconveniences might happen, if they should 
offer to resist Polyphemus, who had now the power over them.
     Sec. 229.  The end of government is the good of mankind; and 
which is best for mankind, that the people should be always 
exposed to the boundless will of tyranny, or that the rulers 
should be sometimes liable to be opposed, when they grow 
exorbitant in the use of their power, and employ it for the 
destruction, and not the preservation of the properties of their 
people?
     Sec. 230.  Nor let any one say, that mischief can arise from 
hence, as often as it shall please a busy head, or turbulent 
spirit, to desire the alteration of the government.  It is true, 
such men may stir, whenever they please; but it will be only to 
their own just ruin and perdition: for till the mischief be grown 
general, and the ill designs of the rulers become visible, or 
their attempts sensible to the greater part, the people, who are 
more disposed to suffer than right themselves by resistance, are 
not apt to stir.  The examples of particular injustice, or 
oppression of here and there an unfortunate man, moves them not.  
But if they universally have a persuation, grounded upon manifest 
evidence, that designs are carrying on against their liberties, 
and the general course and tendency of things cannot but give 
them strong suspicions of the evil intention of their governors, 
who is to be blamed for it?  Who can help it, if they, who might 
avoid it, bring themselves into this suspicion?  Are the people 
to be blamed, if they have the sense of rational creatures, and 
can think of things no otherwise than as they find and feel them?  
And is it not rather their fault, who put things into such a 

posture, that they would not have them thought to be as they are?  
I grant, that the pride, ambition, and turbulency of private men 
have sometimes caused great disorders in commonwealths, and 
factions have been fatal to states and kingdoms.  But whether the 
mischief hath oftener begun in the peoples wantonness, and a 
desire to cast off the lawful authority of their rulers, or in 
the rulers insolence, and endeavours to get and exercise an 
arbitrary power over their people; whether oppression, or 
disobedience, gave the first rise to the disorder, I leave it to 
impartial history to determine.  This I am sure, whoever, either 
ruler or subject, by force goes about to invade the rights of 
either prince or people, and lays the foundation for overturning 
the constitution and frame of any just government, is highly 
guilty of the greatest crime, I think, a man is capable of, being 
to answer for all those mischiefs of blood, rapine, and 
desolation, which the breaking to pieces of governments bring on 
a country.  And he who does it, is justly to be esteemed the 
common enemy and pest of mankind, and is to be treated 
accordingly.
         Sec. 231.  That subjects or foreigners, attempting by 
force on the properties of any people, may be resisted with 
force, is agreed on all hands.  But that magistrates, doing the 
same thing, may be resisted, hath of late been denied: as if 
those who had the greatest privileges and advantages by the law, 
had thereby a power to break those laws, by which alone they were 
set in a better place than their brethren: whereas their offence 
is thereby the greater, both as being ungrateful for the greater 
share they have by the law, and breaking also that trust, which 
is put into their hands by their brethren.
         Sec. 232.  Whosoever uses force without right, as every 
one does in society, who does it without law, puts himself into a 
state of war with those against whom he so uses it; and in that 
state all former ties are cancelled, all other rights cease, and 
every one has a right to defend himself, and to resist the 
aggressor.  This is so evident, that Barclay himself, that great 
assertor of the power and sacredness of kings, is forced to 
confess, That it is lawful for the people, in some cases, to 
resist their king; and that too in a chapter, wherein he pretends 
to shew, that the divine law shuts up the people from all manner 
of rebellion.  Whereby it is evident, even by his own doctrine, 
that, since they may in some cases resist, all resisting of 
princes is not rebellion.  His words are these.  Quod siquis 
dicat, Ergone populus tyrannicae crudelitati & furori jugulum 
semper praebebit?  Ergone multitude civitates suas fame, ferro, & 
flamma vastari, seque, conjuges, & liberos fortunae ludibrio & 
tyranni libidini exponi, inque omnia vitae pericula omnesque 
miserias & molestias a rege deduci patientur?  Num illis quod 
omni animantium generi est a natura tributum, denegari debet, ut 
sc. vim vi repellant, seseq; ab injuria, tueantur?  Huic breviter 
responsum sit, Populo universo negari defensionem, quae juris 
naturalis est, neque ultionem quae praeter naturam est adversus 
regem concedi debere.   Quapropter si rex non in singulares 
tantum personas aliquot privatum odium exerceat, sed corpus etiam 
reipublicae, cujus ipse caput est, i.e.  totum populum, vel 
insignem aliquam ejus partem immani & intoleranda saevitia seu 
tyrannide divexet; populo, quidem hoc casu resistendi ac tuendi 
se ab injuria potestas competit, sed tuendi se tantum, non enim 
in principem invadendi: & restituendae injuriae illatae, non 
recedendi a debita reverentia propter acceptam injuriam.  
Praesentem denique impetum propulsandi non vim praeteritam 
ulciscenti jus habet.  Horum enim alterum a natura est, ut vitam 
scilicet corpusque tueamur.  Alterum vero contra naturam, ut 
inferior de superiori supplicium sumat.  Quod itaque populus 
malum, antequam factum sit, impedire potest, ne fiat, id postquam 
factum est, in regem authorem sceleris vindicare non potest: 
populus igitur hoc amplius quam privatus quispiam habet: quod 

huic, vel ipsis adversariis judicibus, excepto Buchanano, nullum 
nisi in patientia remedium superest.  Cum ille si intolerabilis 
tyrannus est (modicum enim ferre omnino debet) resistere cum 
reverentia possit, Barclay contra Monarchom.  1. iii. c. 8.

     In English thus:

     Sec. 233.  But if any one should ask, Must the people then 
always lay themselves open to the cruelty and rage of tyranny?  
Must they see their cities pillaged, and laid in ashes, their 
wives and children exposed to the tyrant's lust and fury, and 
themselves and families reduced by their king to ruin, and all 
the miseries of want and oppression, and yet sit still?  Must men 
alone be debarred the common privilege of opposing force with 
force, which nature allows so freely to all other creatures for 
their preservation from injury?  I answer: Self-defence is a part 
of the law of nature; nor can it be denied the community, even 
against the king himself: but to revenge themselves upon him, 
must by no means be allowed them; it being not agreeable to that 
law.  Wherefore if the king shall shew an hatred, not only to 
some particular persons, but sets himself against the body of the 
common-wealth, whereof he is the head, and shall, with 
intolerable ill usage, cruelly tyrannize over the u7hole, or a 
considerable part of the people, in this case the people have a 
right to resist and defend themselves from injury: but it must be 
with this caution, that they only defend themselves, but do not 
attack their prince: they may repair the damages received, but 
must not for any provocation exceed the bounds of due reverence 
and respect.  They may repulse the present attempt, but must not 
revenge past violences: for it is natural for us to defend life 
and limb, but that an inferior should punish a superior, is 
against nature.  The mischief which is designed them, the people 
may prevent before it be done; but when it is done, they must not 
revenge it on the king, though author of the villany.  This 
therefore is the privilege of the people in general, above what 
any private person hath; that particular men are allowed by our 
adversaries themselves (Buchanan only excepted) to have no other 
remedy but patience; but the body of the people may with respect 
resist intolerable tyranny; for when it is but moderate, they 
ought to endure it.
     Sec. 234.  Thus far that great advocate of monarchical power 
allows of resistance.
     Sec. 235.  It is true, he has annexed two limitations to it, 
to no purpose:
     First, He says, it must be with reverence.
     Secondly, It must be without retribution, or punishment; and 
the reason he gives is, because an inferior cannot punish a 
superior.
     First, How to resist force without striking again, or how to 
strike with reverence, will need some skill to make intelligible.  
He that shall oppose an assault only with a shield to receive the 
blows, or in any more respectful posture, without a sword in his 
hand, to abate the confidence and force of the assailant, will 
quickly be at an end of his resistance, and will find such a 
defence serve only to draw on himself the worse usage.  This is 
as ridiculous a way of resisting, as juvenal thought it of 
fighting; ubi tu pulsas, ego vapulo tantum.   And the success of 
the combat will be unavoidably the same he there describes it:

      ----- Libertas pauperis haec est:
      Pulsatus rogat, & pugnis concisus, adorat,
      Ut liceat paucis cum dentibus inde reverti.

This will always be the event of such an imaginary resistance, 
where men may not strike again.  He therefore who may resist, 
must be allowed to strike.  And then let our author, or any body 

else, join a knock on the head, or a cut on the face, with as 
much reverence and respect as he thinks fit.  He that can 
reconcile blows and reverence, may, for aught I know, desire for 
his pains, a civil, respectful cudgeling where-ever he can meet 
with it.
     Secondly, As to his second, An inferior cannot punish a 
superior; that is true, generally speaking, whilst he is his 
superior.  But to resist force with force, being the state of war 
that levels the parties, cancels all former relation of 
reverence, respect, and superiority: and then the odds that 
remains, is, that he, who opposes the unjust agressor, has this 
superiority over him, that he has a right, when he prevails, to 
punish the offender, both for the breach of the peace, and all 
the evils that followed upon it.  Barclay therefore, in another 
place, more coherently to himself, denies it to be lawful to 
resist a king in any case.  But he there assigns two cases, 
whereby a king may un-king himself.  His words are,
     Quid ergo, nulline casus incidere possunt quibus populo sese 
erigere atque in regem impotentius dominantem arma capere & 
invadere jure suo suaque authoritate liceat?  Nulli certe quamdiu 
rex manet.  Semper enim ex divinis id obstat, Regem honorificato; 
& qui potestati resistit, Dei ordinationi resisit: non alias 
igitur in eum populo potestas est quam si id committat propter 
quod ipso jure rex esse desinat.  Tunc enim se ipse principatu 
exuit atque in privatis constituit liber: hoc modo populus & 
superior efficitur, reverso ad eum sc.  jure illo quod ante regem 
inauguratum in interregno habuit.   At sunt paucorum generum 
commissa ejusmodi quae hunc effectum pariunt.  At ego cum plurima 
animo perlustrem, duo tantum invenio, duos, inquam, casus quibus 
rex ipso facto ex rege non regem se facit & omni honore & 
dignitate regali atque in subditos potestate destituit; quorum 
etiam meminit Winzerus.  Horum unus est, Si regnum disperdat, 
quemadmodum de Nerone fertur, quod is nempe senatum populumque 
Romanum, atque adeo urbem ipsam ferro flammaque vastare, ac novas 
sibi sedes quaerere decrevisset.  Et de Caligula, quod palam 
denunciarit se neque civem neque principem senatui amplius fore, 
inque animo habuerit interempto utriusque ordinis electissimo 
quoque Alexandriam commigrare, ac ut populum uno ictu 
interimeret, unam ei cervicem optavit.  Talia cum rex aliquis 
meditator & molitur serio, omnem regnandi curam & animum ilico 
abjicit, ac proinde imperium in subditos amittit, ut dominus 
servi pro derelicto habiti dominium.
     Sec. 236.  Alter casus est, Si rex in alicujus clientelam se 
contulit, ac regnum quod liberum a majoribus & populo traditum 
accepit, alienae ditioni mancipavit.  Nam tunc quamvis forte non 
ea mente id agit populo plane ut incommodet: tamen quia quod 
praecipuum est regiae dignitatis amifit, ut summus scilicet in 
regno secundum Deum sit, & solo Deo inferior, atque populum etiam 
totum ignorantem vel invitum, cujus libertatem sartam & tectam 
conservare debuit, in alterius gentis ditionem & potestatem 
dedidit; hac velut quadam regni ab alienatione effecit, ut nec 
quod ipse in regno imperium habuit retineat, nec in eum cui 
collatum voluit, juris quicquam transferat; atque ita eo facto 
liberum jam & suae potestatis populum relinquit, cujus rei 
exemplum unum annales Scotici suppeditant.   Barclay contra 
Monarchom. 1. iii. c. 16.

    Which in English runs thus:

     Sec. 237.  What then, can there no case happen wherein the 
people may of right, and by their own authority, help themselves, 
take arms, and set upon their king, imperiously domineering over 
them?  None at all, whilst he remains a king.  Honour the king, 
and he that resists the power, resists the ordinance of God; are 
divine oracles that will never permit it, The people therefore 
can never come by a power over him, unless he does something that 

makes him cease to be a king: for then he divests himself of his 
crown and dignity, and returns to the state of a private man, and 
the people become free and superior, the power which they had in 
the interregnum, before they crowned him king, devolving to them 
again.  But there are but few miscarriages which bring the matter 
to this state.  After considering it well on all sides, I can 
find but two.  Two cases there are, I say, whereby a king, ipso 
facto, becomes no king, and loses all power and regal authority 
over his people; which are also taken notice of by Winzerus.
     The first is, If he endeavour to overturn the government, 
that is, if he have a purpose and design to ruin the kingdom and 
commonwealth, as it is recorded of Nero, that he resolved to cut 
off the senate and people of Rome, lay the city waste with fire 
and sword, and then remove to some other place.  And of Caligula, 
that he openly declared, that he would be no longer a head to the 
people or senate, and that he had it in his thoughts to cut off 
the worthiest men of both ranks, and then retire to Alexandria: 
and he wisht that the people had but one neck, that he might 
dispatch them all at a blow, Such designs as these, when any king 
harbours in his thoughts, and seriously promotes, he immediately 
gives up all care and thought of the common-wealth; and 
consequently forfeits the power of governing his subjects, as a 
master does the dominion over his slaves whom he hath abandoned.
     Sec. 238.  The other case is, When a king makes himself the 
dependent of another, and subjects his kingdom which his 
ancestors left him, and the people put free into his hands, to 
the dominion of another: for however perhaps it may not be his 
intention to prejudice the people; yet because he has hereby lost 
the principal part of regal dignity, viz.  to be next and 
immediately under God, supreme in his kingdom; and also because 
he betrayed or forced his people, whose liberty he ought to have 
carefully preserved, into the power and dominion of a foreign 
nation.  By this, as.  it were, alienation of his kingdom, he 
himself loses the power he had in it before, without transferring 
any the least right to those on whom he would have bestowed it; 
and so by this act sets the people free, and leaves them at their 
own disposal.  One example of this is to be found in the Scotch 
Annals.
     Sec. 239.  In these cases Barclay, the great champion of 
absolute monarchy, is forced to allow, that a king may be 
resisted, and ceases to be a king.  That is, in short, not to 
multiply cases, in whatsoever he has no authority, there he is no 
king, and may be resisted: for wheresoever the authority ceases, 
the king ceases too, and becomes like other men who have no 
authority.  And these two cases he instances in, differ little 
from those above mentioned, to be destructive to governments, 
only that he has omitted the principle from which his doctrine 
flows: and that is, the breach of trust, in not preserving the 
form of government agreed on, and in not intending the end of 
government itself, which is the public good and preservation of 
property.  When a king has dethroned himself, and put himself in 
a state of war with his people, what shall hinder them from 
prosecuting him who is no king, as they would any other man, who 
has put himself into a state of war with them, Barclay, and those 
of his opinion, would do well to tell us.  This farther I desire 
may be taken notice of out of Barclay, that he says, The mischief 
that is designed them, the people may prevent before it be clone: 
whereby he allows resistance when tyranny is but in design.  Such 
designs as these (says he) when any king harbours in his thoughts 
and seriously promotes, he immediately gives up all care and 
thought of the common-wealth; so that, according to him, the 
neglect of the public good is to be taken as an evidence of such 
design, or at least for a sufficient cause of resistance.  And 
the reason of all, he gives in these words, Because he betrayed 
or forced his people, whose liberty he ought carefully to have 
preserved.  What he adds, into the power and dominion of a 

foreign nation, signifies nothing, the fault and forfeiture lying 
in the loss of their liberty, which he ought to have preserved, 
and not in any distinction of the persons to whose dominion they 
were subjected.  The peoples right is equally invaded, and their 
liberty lost, whether they are made slaves to any of their own, 
or a foreign nation; and in this lies the injury, and against 
this only have they the right of defence.  And there are 
instances to be found in all countries, which shew, that it is 
not the change of nations in the persons of their governors, but 
the change of government, that gives the offence.  Bilson, a 
bishop of our church, and a great stickler for the power and 
prerogative of princes, does, if I mistake not, in his treatise 
of Christian subjection, acknowledge, that princes may forfeit 
their power, and their title to the obedience of their subjects; 
and if there needed authority in a case where reason is so plain, 
I could send my reader to Bracton, Fortescue, and the author of 
the Mirrour, and others, writers that cannot be suspected to be 
ignorant of our government, or enemies to it.  But I thought 
Hooker alone might be enough to satisfy those men, who relying on 
him for their ecclesiastical polity, are by a strange fate 
carried to deny those principles upon which he builds it.   
Whether they are herein made the tools of cunninger workmen, to 
pull down their own fabric, they were best look.  This I am sure, 
their civil policy is so new, so dangerous, and so destructive to 
both rulers and people, that as former ages never could bear the 
broaching of it; so it may be hoped, those to come, redeemed from 
the impositions of these Egyptian under-task-masters, will abhor 
the memory of such servile flatterers, who, whilst it seemed to 
serve their turn, resolved all government into absolute tyranny, 
and would have all men born to, what their mean souls fitted them 
for, slavery.
     Sec. 240.  Here, it is like, the common question will be 
made, Who shall be judge, whether the prince or legislative act 
contrary to their trust?  This, perhaps, ill-affected and 
factious men may spread amongst the people, when the prince only 
makes use of his due prerogative.  To this I reply, The people 
shall be judge; for who shall be judge whether his trustee or 
deputy acts well, and according to the trust reposed in him, but 
he who deputes him, and must, by having deputed him, have still a 
power to discard him, when he fails in his trust?  If this be 
reasonable in particular cases of private men, why should it be 
otherwise in that of the greatest moment, where the welfare of 
millions is concerned, and also where the evil, if not prevented, 
is greater, and the redress very difficult, dear, and dangerous?
     Sec. 241.  But farther, this question, (Who shall be judge?) 
cannot mean, that there is no judge at all: for where there is no 
judicature on earth, to decide controversies amongst men, God in 
heaven is judge.  He alone, it is true, is judge of the right.  
But every man is judge for himself, as in all other cases, so in 
this, whether another hath put himself into a state of war with 
him, and whether he should appeal to the Supreme Judge, as leptha 
did.
     Sec. 242.  If a controversy arise betwixt a prince and some 
of the people, in a matter where the law is silent, or doubtful, 
and the thing be of great consequence, I should think the proper 
umpire, in such a case, should be the body of the people: for in 
cases where the prince hath a trust reposed in him, and is 
dispensed from the common ordinary rules of the law; there, if 
any men find themselves aggrieved, and think the prince acts 
contrary to, or beyond that trust, who so proper to judge as the 
body of the people, (who, at first, lodged that trust in him) how 
far they meant it should extend?  But if the prince, or whoever 
they be in the administration, decline that way of determination, 
the appeal then lies no where but to heaven; force between either 
persons, who have no known superior on earth, or which permits no 
appeal to a judge on earth, being properly a state of war, 

wherein the appeal lies only to heaven; and in that state the 
injured party must judge for himself, when he will think fit to 
make use of that appeal, and put himself upon it.
     Sec. 243.  To conclude, The power that every individual gave 
the society, when he entered into it, can never revert to the 
individuals again, as long as the society lasts, but will always 
remain in the community; because without this there can be no 
community, no common-wealth, which is contrary to the original 
agreement: so also when the society hath placed the legislative 
in any assembly of men, to continue in them and their successors, 
with direction and authority for providing such successors, the 
legislative can never revert to the people whilst that government 
lasts; because having provided a legislative with power to 
continue for ever, they have given up their political power to 
the legislative, and cannot resume it.  But if they have set 
limits to the duration of their legislative, and made this 
supreme power in any person, or assembly, only temporary; or 
else, when by the miscarriages of those in authority, it is 
forfeited; upon the forfeiture, or at the determination of the 
time set, it reverts to the society, and the people have a right 
to act as supreme, and continue the legislative in themselves; or 
erect a new form, or under the old form place it in new hands, as 
they think good.

    A woman could never get her husband to do anything around the house. He would come home from work, sit in front of the tv, eat dinner, and sit some more--would never do those little household repairs that most husbands take care of. This frustrated the woman quite a bit.
    One day the toilet stopped up. When her husband got home, she said sweetly, "Honey, the toilet is clogged. Would you look at it?"
    Her husband snarled, "What do I look like? The tidy-bowl man?" and sat down on the sofa.
    The next day, the garbage disposal wouldn't work. When her husband got home, she said, very nicely, "Honey, the disposal won't work. Would you try to fix it for me?"
    Once again, he growled, "What do I look like? Mr. Plumber?"
    The next day, the washing machine was on the blink. When her husband got home, she steeled her courage and said, "Honey, the washer isn't running. Would you check on it?" 
    And again was met with a snarl, "What do I look like? The Maytag repairman?"
    Finally, she had had enough. The next morning, the woman called three repairmen to fix the toilet, the garbage disposal, and the washer. When her husband got home, she said, "Honey, I had the repairmen out today."
    He frowned, "Well, how much is that going to cost?"
    "Well, honey, they all said I could pay them by baking them a cake or having
sex with them."
    "Well, what kind of cakes did you bake them?" he asked.
She smiled. "What do I look like? Betty Crocker?"


[22]
Jesus is preaching to a mob which is about to stone a whore.  He says to the

    "Let he who is whithout sin cast the first stone."

the hell out of the whore.  Jesus turns to the old woman and says:

   "Sometimes you realy piss me off, mom."

Hymie is new to the country, and goes to see about getting a commission house.  The government guy looks at him and says, "Can I have your name please?", to which Hymie says (strangely enough) "Hymie". "And what is your religion?" "I'M Jewish".  "I'm very sorry, but we can't help you"
Hymie is pissed off.  He visits his friend Isaac and tells him his problem.
I: "Did you tell him you are Jewish"
H: "He asked my religion, of course I told him I'm Jewish"
I: "Dont tell them your Jewish - tell them your Catholic"
So Hymie goes back the next day to try again.

H: "Mary, and his father's name was Joseph"
GG:"And where was Jesus born?"
H: "In a stable in Bethlehem."
GG:"And why was he born in a stable?"

    He keeps on fucking her until he explodes inside her.  After, while they are lying together on the bed, he asks her:

er again with much excitment.  20 minutes later the teacher comes out and tells me that it's OK to come back in.  I tell the teacher that I thought of a poem and would like to recite it to the class.  She tells me she would like to here it first.

 get into class and the teacher says; "Class, Tommy has a poem that he would like to recite!"  I stand up in front of the class with a proud look on my face and recite; 
        "As I stand here in the hall, 
        I see this roach on the wall...WITH HIS COCK OUT!"

Once  there was this little nonconforming sparrow who decided not to fly 
south  for the winter.  After awhile it got too cold for the poor sparrow 
and he  reluctantly started his flight south.  Slow ice began forming on 
the  sparrow's wings causing him to come crashing down to the ground.  
Then  a cow came a long and crapped on the sparrow.  He thought he was 
done  for, but to his surprise the shit was nice and warm and began to 
thaw  out his wings.  The sparrow was so happy he becan to sing.  A near 
by cat heard the singing and decided to investigate.  He found the 
sparrow under  the pile of shit, so he uncovered the sparrow and promptly 
ate him.

    Down on the street, there are two cops, and they hear the bone crunching sound.  "What was that?!" said one cop.
    The other one replied, "Oh, it's just Superman fucking with them 
polacks again!"

A drunk walks into a crowded bar and takes the last barstool next to an older woman.  After awhile, the woman starts to smell this horrible odor coming from the direction of the drunk.  She turns to him and says, "Excuse me Mister, but did you just shit yourself?"    The drunk replied, "Yes ma'am, I have indeed shit myself."
The woman says, "Well, why don't you go somewhere and clean yourself up?"
    The drunk says, "'Cos I'm not finished yet..."

Rob : That's bad!
Bill: Well, not so bad, for she perished in the flames.
Rob : That's good!
Bill: Yeah!

Santa drops down a chimney, and there in front of him is a barely dressed girl lying on the couch.
    "Stay a while..." she moans quietly.  
Santa looks at her and says "Ho Ho Ho, Gotta go, Got a lotta work to do, you know." and disappears up the chimney.

Next house, Santa drops in, and there is the daughter of the house, stark naked on the carpet, ready, willing and all too obviously very able.
    "Oh please, Santa, will you give me a very special Christmas present" she asks. 
To this Santa replies:  "Hay, Hay, Hay, Gotta stay, Can't get out the chimney with my dick this way."

 Once in the garden of Eden, Adam looked at Eve, and found she was missing
a cunt.  So he called the stork, and asked it to drill her a hole.
She was still missing the hair, Adam thought, so he called the skunk, ripped
off a piece of the animals hair, and placed it on Eve. Much better, but she was still very bloody in certain places. 
Therefore Adam threw her into the ocean. As she came out of the water a
herring fell out of her newly made hole. Today we can see that the stork has a red beak and that the skunk 
has a white back, but we have never found out whether a cunt smells like  
the herring or the herring smells like a cunt..

 A little girl is sitting on the sidewalk crying...A helpful man asks her :
    "Why are you crying, little girl ?"
    "My cat just had 3 beautyful kitties (is it the correct word ?) and my
     father killed them !!!"
    "Oh, I see, you wanted to keep them. But you know, 4 cats at home is
     difficult."
    "NO ! I wanted to kill them myself."

          Sex Life of an Electron
                  -----------------------
    One night when his charge was at full capacity, Micro Farad decided to get a cute little coil to discharge him.
He picked up Millie Amp and took her for a ride on his megacycle. The rode across Wheatstone Bridge, around the Sine
Wave and into a magnetic field next to a flowing circuit. Micro Farad, attracted by Millie's characteristic curves,
soon had her fields fully excited. He laid her on the ground potential, raised her frequency, lowered her resistance and
pulled out his high voltage probe. He inserted it in parallel and began to short circuit her shunt. Fully excited,
Millie cried "Ohm, ohm, give me more ohm!!" With his tube at maximum output and her coil vibrating from the current flow,
her shunt soon reached maximum heat. The excess current had shorted her shunt and Micro's capacity was rapidly discharged
and drained of every electron. They fluxed all night trying various connections and
hookups until his bar magnet had lost all of its strength and he could no longer generate enough voltage to sustain
the collapsing field. With his battery fully discharged, Micro was unable to excite his transformer, so they ended
up reversing polarity and blowing each other's fuses.

    One day the Holy Church of Whatever were sad because the same curch bell ringer they've had for 50 years died.  Now they had to find
a new one, so they put up postings that said  "Church bell ringer wanted.  Apply in person."
    So they wait and one day a man comes and applies.  "But you've got no arms."  said the preacher.  "Just give me a chance."  he says.
So they bring him up to the tower and say "OK, let's see what you can do."
    So the guy steps back a couple of feet and runs head first into the bell, and rings it.  The preacher is stunned because the guy
must've hurt himself, but he gets up and he's fine.
    "Not bad, but the bell is rung more than once, you'll kill yourself."   "No, man, watch this."   So the man runs back even
farther and again runs face-first into the bell, ringing it even louder.  The preacher's impressed, but still not sure.
    "OK, then, watch this, and you'll have to hire me."  So he runs back as far as he can go and starts running head first towards
the bell.  The preacher thinks this is far too dangerous and takes the bell and holds it out of the way.  Unfortunately, the guy doesn't see
the bell is gone and runs straight over the edge of the tower and falls to his death below.
When the cops arrive, they start asking questions from the preacher.  "Did you know the victim?"
    And the preacher replies,  "Well, I don't know his name but  his face 
rings a bell."

[294]
So here I am, sitting at Bocci's after work. I'm sitting there
for about an hour, talking to a friend of mine, and out of the 
corner of my eye, I see this old man over by the door starting
to slip out of his stool, and he finally came to rest down by
the floor. I figure the right thing to do is go help him, so I
go down there and give him a hand up. He gets about halfway up,
and starts sliding down.
    "I think it's time for this one to go home," I tells the barten-
der. I ask the guy where he lives, and if he needed a ride home.
He says, "No, I don't have a car, but I only live about 4 houses
down." So, I get the address, and I start to help him off the
barstool, and we start heading out the door. "Vinnie!!" the bar-
tender yells out, but I just wave him off. "It's OK." I says.
"I'll be back in a couple of minutes." So we get close to the door,
and the guy's legs slip out from under him again, and I'm thinking,
"This dude's one fucked up unit!" We get out to the driveway, and
he slips not once, but 2 more times, and I'm getting frustrated.
So, I throw him over my shoulder, and carry him the remaining dis-
tance to his house. I knocks on the door, and his wife says, "Who
is it?"
    I says, "My name is Vinnie, and I brought your husband home." She 
opens the door, and I brush by her, and lay her husband on the
couch. He kind of slides over onto his side, one eye open, the other
mostly closed. There's spit running out the side of his mouth. I
look at the lady, and I say, "Lady, you really ought to talk to
your husband about his drinking."
    She says, "I intend to." Then she looks over my shoulder, and out
on the porch, and asks, "By the way, where did you put his wheel-
chair?"

[295]
 Q: Did you hear about the new sit-com about Lepers and Prostitutes?

There were two church-going women gossiping in front of the
country store when a dusty old cowboy rode up.  He tied up
in front of the saloon, walk around behind his horse, lifted
its tail and kiss the horse full on its asshole.

Repulsed, one of the women asked, "That's disgusting, why did
you do THAT?"

To which the cowboy reply, "I've got chapped lips."

Confused, the woman continued, "Does that make them feel better.

"No, but it stops me from licking them!"

An old wino was stumbling down the street when he came upon a biker bar.  He
decided to go in to spend his last dollar on a brew. 

At the bar he sat down next to a big old biker.  While he was drinking his brew
he kept eyeing the bowl of chili in front of the biker.  After about an hour,
he got up the courage to ask the biker if he could eat his bowl of chili since
the biker hadn't touched it.  The biker said, "Go ahead, man."

The wino ate all the chili and at the bottom of the bowl there was a turd.
When the wino saw the turd, he got sick and threw up in the bowl.  

The biker turned to him and said, "I did the same thing when I got to the 
bottom of the bowl, man."

IT'S A DOG'S LIFE

     Four union workers were discussing how smart there dogs were.

     The first, a United auto workers member said his dog could do math
  calculations. His dog was named T-square, and he told him to go to the
  blackboard and draw a square, a circle, and a triangle--which the dog
  did with no problem.

     the united steel workers members said he thought his dog was
  better. His dog, named sliderule, was told to fetch a dozen cookies
  and to divide tem into four piles of three--which sliderule did with
  no problem.

     The teamsters member said that was pretty good, but he felt his dog
  was even. His dog, named Measure, was told to get a quart of milk and
  to pour 7 ounces into a 10 ounce glass. The dog complied with
  precision.

     The three agreed that the demonstrations were pretty good, and that
  all the dogs were smart. They then turned to the fourth member and
  asked, "What can your dog do".

     The united mine workers member, who hailed from West Virinia,
  called his dog Coffee Break and said, " show the fellas what y'all can
  do".

     Coffee Break went over and pissed on the blackboard, ate all the
  cookies, drank all the milk, screwed the other three dogs; claimed he
  hurt his back,filed for workmans comp. and foodstamps: yapped about
  the unsafe workings conditions, and started a wildcat strike.

 Q: How are lawyers and sperm alike?
         A: They both have a one-in-a-million chance of becomming human.


 Q: Why are guys so smart and girls so talkative?
         A: Because guys have two heads and girls have four lips.

The nine types of users
El Explicito - "I tried the thing, ya know, and it worked, ya know, but now it doesn't, ya know?"
Advantages:  Provides interesting communication challanges.
Disadvantages:  So do chimps.
Symptoms:  Complete inability to use proper nouns
Real Case:  One user walked up to a certain Armenian pod manager and said, "I can't get what I want!"  The pod manager leaned back, put his hands on his belt-buckle, and said, "Well, ma'am, you've come to the right place."

Mad Bomber - "Well, I hit ALT-f6, shift-f8, CNTRL-f10, f4, and f9, and now it looks all weird."
Advantages:  Will try to find own solution to problems.
Disadvantages:  User might have translated document to Navajo without meaning to.
Symptoms:  More than six stopped jobs in UNIX, a 2:1 code-to-letter ratio in WordPerfect
Real Case:  One user came in complaining that his WordPerfect document was underlined.  When I used reveal codes on it, I found that he'd set and unset underline more than fifty times in his document.

Frying Pan/Fire Tactician - "It didn't work with the data set we had, so I fed in my aunt's recipe for key lime pie."
Advantages:  Will usually fix error.
Disadvantages:  'Fix' is defined VERY loosely here.
Symptoms:  A tendancy to delete lines that get errors instead of fixing them.
Real Case:  One user complained that their program executed, but didn't do anything.  The scon looked at it for twenty minutes before realizing that they'd commented out EVERY LINE.  The user said, "Well, that was the only way I could get it to compile."

Shaman - "Last week, when the moon was full, the clouds were thick, and formahaut was above the horizon, I typed f77, and lo, it did compile."
Advantages:  Gives insight into primative mythology.
Disadvantages:  Few scons are anthropology majors.
Symptoms:  Frequent questions about irrelavent objects.
Real Case:  One user complained that all information on one of their disks got erased (as Norton Utilities showed nothing but empty sectors, I suspect nothing had ever been on it).  Reasoning that the deleted information went *somewhere*, they wouldn't shut up until the scon checked four different disks for the missing information.

X-user - "Will you look at those. . .um, that resolution, quite impressive, really."
Advantages:  Using the cutting-edge in graphics technology.
Disadvantages:  Has little or no idea how to use the cutting-edge in graphics technology.
Symptoms:  Fuzzy hands, blindness
Real Case:  When I was off duty, two users sat down in front of me at DEC station 5000/200s that systems was reconfiguring.  I suppressed my laughter while, for twenty minutes, they sat down and did their best to act like they were doing exectly what they wanted to do, even though they couldn't log in.

Miracle Worker - "But it read a file from it yesterday!"  'Sir, at a guess, this disk has been swollowed and regurgitated.'  "But I did that a month ago, and it read a file from it yesterday!"
Advantages:  Apparently has remarkable luck when you aren't around.
Disadvantages:  People complain when scons actually use the word 'horse-puckey'.
Symptoms:  Loses all ability to do impossible when you're around.  Must be the kryptonite in your pocket.
Real Case:  At least three users have claimed that they've loaded IBM WordPerfect from Macintosh disks.

Taskmaster - "Well, this is a file in MacWrite.  Do you know how I can upload it to MUSIC, transfer it over to UNIX from there, download it onto an IBM, convert it to WordPerfect, and put it in three-column format?"
Advantages:  Bold new challanges.
Disadvantages:  Makes one wish to be a garbage collector.
Symptoms:  An inability to keep quiet.  Strong tendancies to make machines do things they don't want to do.
Real Case:  One user tried to get a scon to find out what another person's E-mail address was even though the user didn't know his target's home system, account name, or real name.

Maestro - "Well, first I sat down, like this.  Then I logged on, like this, and after that, I typed in my password, like this, and after that I edited my file, like this, and after that I went to this line here, like this, and after that I picked my nose, like this. . ."
Advantages:  Willing to show you exactly what they did to get an error.
Disadvantages:  For as long as five or six hours.
Symptoms:  Selective deafness to the phrases, "Right, right, okay, but what was the ERROR?", and a strong fondness for the phrase, "Well, I'm getting to that."
Real Case:  I once had to spend half an hour looking over a user's shoulder while they continuously retrieved a document into itself and denied that they did it (the user was complaining that their document was 87 copies of the same thing).

Princess (unfair, perhaps, as these tend, overwhelmingly, to be males) - "I need a Mac, and someone's got the one I like reserved, would you please garrote him and put him in the paper recycling bin?"
Advantages:  Flatters you with their high standards for your service.
Disadvantages:  Impresses you with their obliviousness to other people on this planet.
Symptoms:  Inability to communicate except by complaining.
Real Case:  One asked a scon to remove the message of the day because he (the user) didn't like it.

Subject: Accounting


What's the definition of an accountant?
Someone who solves a problem you didn't know you had in a way you don't 
understand.
     
What's the definition of a good tax accountant? 
Someone who has a loophole named after him.
     
What's an auditor?
Someone who arrives after the battle and bayonets all the wounded.
     
Why did the auditor cross the road?
Because he looked in the file and that's what they did last year.
     
There are three kinds of accountants in the world. Those who can count 
and those who can't.
     
An accountant is having a hard time sleeping and goes to see his doctor. 
"Doctor, I just can't get to sleep at night."
"Have you tried counting sheep?"
"That's the problem - I make a mistake and then spend three hours trying 
to find it."
     
there once was an economist named Wayne, 
who's fringe theories were considered insane, 
with the markets in recession,
his life was an obsession,
to prove that a loss was a gain.
     
Q.  What's the difference between the short and long income tax forms? 
A.  If you use the short form, the government gets your money.
If you use the long form, the accountant gets your money.
     
A lawyer and an accountant are fishing in the Caribbean. The lawyer 
says, "I had a terrible fire; lost everything. Now the insurance 
company is paying for everything and that's why I'm here." The 
accountant says, "What a coincidence. I had a terrible flood; lost 
everything. Now the insurance company is paying for everything and 
that's why I'm here." The lawyer turned to him with confusion and says, 
"How do you start a flood?"
     
An accountant dies and goes to Heaven. As he is met by St Peter, he starts 
whining that at 37, he's much too young to die.  St. Peter replies "That's 
impossible!  According to your time sheets you must be at least 97! "

                       "Relativity"

                         PART ONE
 
Meanwhile, in another part of the forest, the top physicists
in the universe (plus a couple of programmers) struggle to
perfect "Dynamo Ada", the very thing on which the future of
the company hangs like a terminal.  The vice president of
the division has bicycled in for a conference with the scientists,
to be briefed on the progress of this critical
project.  (Later, he will attend a meeting of the board of
directors, where he will criticized on the progress of this
brief project.)
 
"How are things progressing?"
 
"Well, not so hot.  We have in fact produced an Ada a
zillion times faster (approximately) than any previously seen, but
there is a slight technical glitch when we actually try to run it."
 
"What kind of glitch?"
 
"Well, it has to do with the Theory of Relativity.  The new Ada
compiler is so fast that it begins to approach the speed of
light."
 
"Are you fellows trying to befuddle me with technical jargon?"
 
"Oh, no sir.  You're befuddled enough to suit us just as you
are.  Now as I was saying, when something begins to approach the
speed of light, there are some relativistic effects.  The mass of
an object is affected, but more importantly time begins to run
slower.  The effect, which is called time dilation, has never been
used in any commercial product except ketchup."  The Vice President was
now beginning to show great interest -- not in the scientist's
explanation, but in a piece of lint on the sleeve of his jacket.
 
"For instance, if a rocket travels to another star at nearly the
speed of light, the trip might seem to take a hundred years to an
external observer, but the occupants of the rocket would only
perceive it as having taken ten years, and would only age ten
years."  The Vice President was nodding now.  Soon he would be
completely asleep.
 
They entered the next room, where a programmer sat before a
terminal, completely immobile.  He did not even appear to be
breathing.  "This man is compiling a five-million-line program
using Dynamo Ada.  From his point of view, the compilation takes
forty-two seconds.  But for an external observer, like us, almost
two days have passed."
 
"Very interesting, very interesting," said the Vice President.  "Is it
time for lunch yet?"

                         PART TWO
                    (two years later)

Scene: the same research installation.  The Vice
President of Bizarre Products Development has arrived to discuss
a matter of great importance.  He is met by Zeke Einstein, a
double Ph.D. in Quantum Physics and Computer Science, who escorts
him into the building.
 
"I was afraid you wouldn't be here," says the V.P.  "I thought
the company had stopped doing pure research."
 
"Oh, we don't do pure research here.  We do 80% research and 20%
playing practical jokes on each other."
 
"By the way, what on earth have you got all over your forehead?"
 
"We'll get to that.  Over there is Biff Einstein.  He's our top
man in computer relativity."
 
"Is everybody here named Einstein?"
 
"No, but whenever we get a chance to hire a physicist named
Einstein, we do it, just to be on the safe side.  Over here is
Bill Blooper.  He's the Director of the research center."
 
"Guten tag," said Blooper.  "Ich bin Ein Stein."
 
"Einstein?  I thought you said his name was Blooper!"
 
"His NAME is Blooper, but he thinks he's a German beer mug.  He's
completely mad, of course, but that's just what it takes to stay on
the cutting edge of today's fast-moving technology.  Now, you wanted
to talk about relativistic computer technology?"
 
"Yes.  I don't know too much about it, so I'd appreciate it if
you'd fill me in."
 
"I thought your organization had already developed a product
based on the technology.  That was almost three years ago, wasn't
it?"
 
"That's true, but I wasn't in charge when it started, so I'm not
clear on all the concepts.  The only engineer who really
understands it is currently finishing up the Unit Test, so
naturally he's a bit difficult to talk to right now ..."
 
"Well, let me start at the beginning.  You're aware of the fact
that all data is composed of quantum particles, which sometimes
act like waves, in a manner similar to photons?"
 
"You mean bits?"

"Well, not quite.  The particulate nature of data means that
you can never have one and a half bits of information; it has
to come in quantum-sized packets.  The term "bit" refers to
the measure of information, but the subatomic particles
themselves are generally called logons or offons.  Now, the fact
is that logons travel at the same speed as light.  For instance,
when data is passed through a wire, even though the individual
electrons propogate along the wire very slowly, the data itself
moves at light speed."
 
"That doesn't sound reasonable."
 
"Well, I can demonstrate it to you quite easily.  Here, hold this
wire."
 
"What are you -- Yow!  You gave me a shock!"
 
"Well, yes, of course.  But how FAST did you get it?  One of the
new technologies we're investigating is the possible
existence of an anti-logon particle.  If it exists, we would be
able to construct retroactive memory chips with an access time of
up to negative 30 microseconds."
 
"And if such a particle doesn't it exist?"
 
"Well, we'll have to invent one.  That will more expensive,
of course."
 
"I don't seem to be getting all this."
 
"Well, of course not.  As I said, information particles behave a
lot like photons.  For instance, a mirror reflects almost all of
the light that hits it, whereas a black surface absorbs almost
all of it.  In the same way, different materials reflect or
absorb data particles at different rates.  The human head, we have
found, is one of the most perfect data reflectors in the universe.
However, just let me put some of this data-absorbing paint on your
head and you'll begin to understand me much better."
 
"Careful.  This is a brand new suit."
 
"Oh, it washes right out, don't worry.  Now, I was saying that
with an anti-logon particle we would be able to construct memory
devices with negative access times."
 
"There would have to be some programming changes there, to allow
for reading data out before it's been written."
 
"Now you're getting it."
 
"Can I have some of this paint to take back with me?  I know some
people who could use it."

"Of course.  That reminds me.  One other thing I've been warning
people about. We're now entering an era where gigabytes of memory
are not uncommon."
 
"Yes?"
 
"We're not certain yet, but we're afraid that a large enough
gathering of logons in very close proximity may cause it to reach
critical mass."
 
"What happens then?"
 
"We don't know.  It could mean another Big Bang.  Or the
formation of some sort of object similar to a black hole, from
which no data ever escapes."
 
"But what about relativistic programming?  We're getting off the
subject."
 
"Well, the thing of it is that at a high enough computational
speed, you get effects similar to those produced by an object
moving at close to light speed.  Time dilation and so forth."
 
"That's why it's taking so long for this Unit Test phase, as I
understand it."
 
"Exactly.  To the tester himself, things seem to be going along
quite quickly.  But to an outside observer, it seems to be moving
very slowly.  Time proceeds at different rates.  Probably the
developer himself appears smaller."
 
"Well, I didn't know him before, but these days he's about two
feet tall, so I suppose you're right.  Anyway, what I came here
to discuss is the possibility of producing more products using
the technology."
 
"Why would you want to, if you can't get them out the door?"
 
"Well, the customers seem to be impressed with them, as long as
they're affected by this relativity thing.  The only real problem
has been test time.  And we think we have a solution to that."
 
"Yes?"
 
"Rigorous code inspections.  If we remove all the defects by
inspection, we don't have to do much testing, and we can ship the
products the same century we build them.  Do you see any potential
problems with that?"
 
"Well, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle would seem to imply
that, if you know the value assigned to a logon, it may be
impossible to determine for certain that a program assigns the
value you wanted."

"But does the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle apply to data
particles?"
 
"I'm not certain."
 
"Is there anything else you want to tell me?"
 
"No.  Let me know how you make out with your new products."
 
"Certainly.  And let me know when you find an anti-logon."
 
"Actually, since it will allow us to print and mail the report
before we write it, you may know about it before we do."
 
"That's enough.  I've got to get back to the office."
 
                             THE END

TOP TIPS


Weight watchers.  Avoid that devilish temptation to nibble at the
chocolate bar in the cupboard or fridge by not buying the fucking
thing in the first place, you fat bastards.


Dyslexics.  Try deliberately spelling words wrongly.  This way at
least you have a chance of spelling them correctly.


Bearded men can obtain the appearance of an upper class Arctic
explore by simply applying Tippex to their beards, painting their
noses blue, and cutting off a couple of toes.  It never fails to 
impress the girls.


Give up smoking by sticking one cigarette from each new pack up a
fat  friend's arse, filter first, then replacing it in the box.
The possibility of putting that one in your mouth will put you off
smoking any of them.


Pretend to be Welsh by putting coal dust behind your ears,
talking gibberish and singing all the time.


If a small child is choking on an ice cube, don't panic. Simply
pour a jug of boiling water down its throat and hey presto!  The
blockage is almost instantly removed.


Avoid cutting yourself while clumsily slicing vegetables by
getting someone else to hold them while you chop away.


Housewives: When nipping out to the shops, remember to carry a
stiff broom in the boot of your car. Use it to sweep the broken
glass to the side of the road every time you have a minor accident.


Make people think you have an expensive car phone by calling
them, asking them to repeat everything they say and then hanging up
half way through their reply.


Don't invite drug addicts round for a meal on boxing day. They
may find the offer of cold turkey embarrassing or offensive.


Keep the seat next to you on the train vacant by smiling and
nodding at people as they walk up the aisle.


Save on booze by drinking cold tea instead of whisky. The
following morning you can create the effects of a hangover by
drinking a thimble full of washing up liquid and banging your
head repeatedly on the wall.


Make bathtimes as much fun for kiddies as a visit to the seaside
by pouring a bucket of sand, a bag of salt and a dog turd into the
bath.


Make guests believe your home might be bugged by running your
hands under tables and inside lampshades, then turning the shower
on every time you want to speak.


Increase blind people's electricity bills by switching all their
lights on when their guide dog isn't looking.


Recreate the fun of a visit to a public swimming pool in your own
home by filling the bath with cold water, adding two bottles of
bleach, then urinating into it, before jumping in.


Make your girlfriend cry when you're having sex by phoning her up
and telling her.


Girls.  Too old to go on an 18 to 30 holiday?  Simply get pissed,
lie in  a sand pit in your garden and shag every bloke who looks at
you over the fence.


Bus drivers.  Pretend you're an airline pilot by wedging your
accelerator pedal down with a heavy book, securing the steering
wheel  with some old rope, and then strolling back along the bus
chatting casually to the passengers.


International master criminals.  Tell your guards to shoot James
Bond in the head at the first opportunity.  Under no circumstances
give him a guided tour of your base, or leave him in the custody of
attractive women in bikinis.

|                      -------------                       |
|__________________________________________________________|

     First you must obtain (steal) a holding tank. I recommend those 6 gallon
Alhambra water jugs which are often left on porches and in driveways for
refills.  Just take it off the porch at 3:00 AM and run it home.  Now, put it
where you are going to put your still.  They need to be kept together.  Hide
your still even if you don't have parents that will shit when they see it.
This is illegal by federal law, and you could get busted pretty well.  Make
your still so it is collapsible and you can fit it all into a small box. Hide
the box in your room.  When you are going to use the still, take it out and
hide it behind some bushes where a passing state trooper, snoopy neighbor, or
phed busting you for pirated games won't see it.  Keep the Alhambra jug where
the still is going to be, cause they are way too big to hide anywhere.

     Also, keep your still somewhere with a good breeze or away from people
who will smell it.  When you are fermenting the shit, it will smell like puke
or even worse.  When you are distilling it, your heater might put off smoke.
The alcohol will smell like alcohol, and heated mash smells worse than shit.

     Now go buy a shitload of fresh or frozen whatever (check the list
below).  Frozen corn will be easiest to deal with because it is already cut
off the cob and is very forgiving with beginners.  Besides, it's all part of a
great American tradition: Moonshine!

+--------------------------+------------------------+
|  Ingredient              | Product                |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
|  Rye or Potatoes         |  Vodka                 |
|  Molasses or Sugar Cane  |  Rum                   |
|  Corn                    |  Moonshine             |
|  Wheat or Rye            |  Whiskey               |
|  Barley or Rice          |  Beer                  |
|  Grapes                  |  Wine                  |
|  Apple Juice             |  Hard Cider            |
|  Sake                    |  Rice                  |
+--------------------------+------------------------+

     Put about 10 bags of corn in each jug and no more, because the carbon
dioxide being released sometime pushes it up and out and you could get the
shit all over the ground. What a waste.  Besides, it will start to rot in the
ground and smell even worse.

     Anyway, add just enough lukewarm water to cover the surface and leave
the stuff exposed to air for about 2 weeks at room temperature.  After a few
days it will bubble and look and smell like puke, but that's no problem.  It
should do that.  Just be sure you've got adequate ventilation.

     Installing a small fan in your Alhambra jug is no problem.  Drilling
holes in the sides of plastic with a sharp drill bit is easy.  Drill two holes
near the top, where there won't be any corn (fans do tend to heat up and short
circuit when exposed to water) and insert two tubes. Make the fan blowing air
into your jug, and not out.  The mist from the mash will wear it down after a
while.

     Now, for the still.  This is complicated, so bear with us.  First, take a
big beaker or something like it and put a big tube going out the top.  You
should glue around this tube, so none of the gas will escape.  Now, run a
smaller tube into the side of the bigger tube, and connect a valve to it.
Now,
connect the other side of the valve to your huge thing of fermented whatever,
but make sure the tube connects at the bottom and goes straight across so the
pressure of the water will push it along the pipe (pumps get too messy).  I
mount my Alhambra jug on bricks, so now the whole thing looks like this:

           |            |  |
 Fermented |   __ __    |  |
    Shit   |_____|______|  |
___________/----|_|-----,  |
  |      |     Valve    |--|
  |------|              /  \
  |Bricks|             /    \
  |------|            /Beaker\
  |______|           (________)


     Now, bend the big pipe around, so it is pointing down at a 45 degree
angle.  Connect a bigger pipe to it.  This will be the condenser.  Connect a
small pipe leading out of the condenser to a big cup or something that you
will catch your 200 proof alcohol in.  Also, make a rack to put the beaker on,
so you can put a can of sterno or a bunsen burner under it.  I would recommend
putting a thermometer inside the beaker, so you can leave the temperature just
above the boiling point of alcohol.  If you don't, you won't get very strong
alcohol.
                          ________
           |             /  ____  \
 Fermented |   __ __    /  /    \  \/\
    Shit   |_____|______|  |     \    \
___________/----|_|-----,  |     /cond-\

  |------|              /  \      \    /
  |Bricks|             /    \      \  /
  |------|            /Beaker\      \ \_____________
  |      |           (________)      \-------------,|
  |------|           /   /\    \        ^ Pipe ^   ||
  |      |          |    \/     |              |___________|
  |------|          |  __||__   |              |  Alcohol  |
  |______|          | |Sterno|  |               \_________/

     Everything should be a little farther apart than depicted in the picture,
but I only wanted to use 60 columns (80 columns with 1 inch margins).
However, the longer the tube leading away from the beaker to the condenser,
the longer the distillation process will take, so keep that quite close.
If you get the alcohol too close to the flame, it might evaporate.  Keep that
at the end of a long pipe.

     Now, there is only one last step.  Take a very long length of surgical
tubing (the stuff they make water weenies out of) and wrap it around the
condenser, leaving almost no space in between coils.  I usually wrap some duct
tape around the tubing so it keeps it in place and insulates it a bit.  Now,
run one end of the tubing to mom's flower garden and the other end to a
valve.  Connect the other end of the valve to a hose or some other cold water
source.  Don't do anything stupid like use liquid nitrogen instead of water
cause it won't speed up the distilling process.  This is what the finished
still should look like:
                          ________
           |             /  ____  \  ______
 Fermented |   __ __    /  /    \  \/,----- -=> Heated
    Shit   |_____|______|  |     \  / \   __ __  Water

  |      |     Valve    |--|     \/ / / >--|_|- <=- Cold

  |Bricks|             /    \      \/ /
  |------|            /Beaker\      \ \_____________
  |      |           (________)      \-------------,|
  |------|           /   /\   \         ^ Pipe ^   ||
  |      |          |    \/    |               |___________|
  |------|          |  __||__  |               |  Alcohol  |
  |______|          | |Sterno| |                \_________/

     A friend of mine was going to be doing a lot of distilling cause he made
a HUGE still.  He was going first- class.  He lived near a creek that stayed
pretty cool, so he was going to figure out how to use that unlimited supply of
water.  The creek grew plenty of bushes, so he hid his still in them.  He even
painted the valves green and stuck them out of the bushes and glued leaves on
to them so nobody could tell it was a still.  But he still didn't have any
water.  He couldn't have a small electric pump, cause he didn't have any
electricity.

     As it turns out, he now has 4 lengths of surgical tubing going down to
the water, around his (superhuge) condenser.  He made a rock and concrete dam
about 3.5 feet high, to get a fast stream of suction.  He  then ran the tubes
down to below the dam, and sucked on them.  He siphons the water up and out of
the creek, through the condenser, and back into the creek.  His still is
awesome!  That thing can run as much as he wants it too, cause he isn't
wasting any water, and it won't show up on any water bill.

     If you are going to be distilling a lot of stuff, you better make a tube
going out of the bottom of the beaker so you can dump out the water and
garbage and every now and then.  Of course, connect it to a valve, so you
won't loose any precious alcohol that's trying to turn into steam in the
beaker.  Make sure any tubes (like this one) aren't made out of glass and can
melt.  It's bad when tubes melt, cause that means you have to rebuild the
still almost from scratch.

     Now that you've got it all set up and the corn (or whatever) is fermented
and hooked up to the beaker, turn the valve on a bit to drip some puke of your
Alhambra jug into your beaker.  Turn on the sterno or bunsen burner to a high
flame so it will heat up the beaker.  Turn on the cold-water valve so you have
cold water flowing around the condenser at a trickle.  If the water coming out
of the condenser is cold, turn the valve so even less water is coming out,
because you don't want to use too much water.  But, if it's warm, it's not
doing its job.  Keep the water coming out about lukewarm.

     As this thing's just starting up, keep a good eye on your thermometer.
You want to keep the temperature just above the boiling point of alcohol
(which is less than the boiling point of water: 212 degrees).  This is so you
can separate the water from the alcohol by turning only the alcohol into
steam, and you can get better stuff.  If you're not sure of the boiling point
of alcohol, ask your science teacher, or look it up, cause I don't know
either.

     Now, watch it, and adjust the valves so the fermented stuff coming out of
the Alhambra jug just equals the steam going up the pipe, and it won't fill up
or boil dry.  Adjust the cold water valve so the water coming out of the
surgical tubing is slightly warm.  Now, wait.  Read a book or download another
Six Feet Under production, but always keep an eye on the still.  When the
Alhambra jug is empty and the beaker is dry, you are done.  Don't expect this
to go very quick, however.

     If you like almost pure alcohol, distill it again.  If you do it right,
you could have no water at all inside your liquid high.  However, even I
haven't been able to get a batch that good.  All it takes is practice and
getting to know your still.  They all have different personalities.

     You now have around 198 proof ethyl alcohol in that collecting cup.  Pour
the alcohol through activated charcoal to remove that nasty shit that makes
you retarded and blind. The stuff is now safe to drink, but don't.  One swig
of 200 proof alcohol will probably kill you.  150 proof is only for
experienced drinkers (derelicts).  The highest proof I've ever had is 138, and
it must have been the worst experience of my life.

     Now, mix it in with about 3 parts alcohol and 5 parts Kool-Aid or
distilled water or something.  The more Kool-Aid or water, the less the
proofage.  To give you an idea, beer is around 6 proof, wine coolers are
around 12, and wine is around 20.  I wouldn't recommend more than 100 proof at
all. If this is your first time, make sure you have a little bit alcohol and a
shitload of Kool-Aid.  You probably won't notice the taste or overdose that
way.

     If it goes wrong, keep trying.  Usually the first time, the stuff will
taste like shit and be almost all water.  It just takes some practice.  Also,
proof is roughly percentage times 2.  50% alcohol is 100 proof alcohol.  100%
is way too high to drink.  Never go above 75 percent alcohol (3 parts alcohol,
1 part something else), which is 150 proof.  That shit could kill you.

See ya then....

Aesop's Fables Translated by George Fyler Townsend 



 
The Wolf and the Lamb 
 
WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to
lay violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the
Lamb the Wolf's right to eat him.  He thus addressed him:
"Sirrah, last year you grossly insulted me."  "Indeed," bleated
the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice, "I was not then born."  Then
said the Wolf, "You feed in my pasture."  "No, good sir," replied
the Lamb, "I have not yet tasted grass."  Again said the Wolf,
"You drink of my well."  "No," exclaimed the Lamb, "I never yet
drank water, for as yet my mother's milk is both food and drink
to me."  Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying,
"Well! I won't remain supperless, even though you refute every
one of my imputations."  The tyrant will always find a pretext for
his tyranny.   


The Bat and the Weasels 
 
A BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleaded
to be spared his life.  The Weasel refused, saying that he was by
nature the enemy of all birds.  The Bat assured him that he was
not a bird, but a mouse, and thus was set free.  Shortly
afterwards the Bat again fell to the ground and was caught by
another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated not to eat him.  The
Weasel said that he had a special hostility to mice.  The Bat
assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a second
time escaped.  
 
It is wise to turn circumstances to good account.  

 
The Ass and the Grasshopper 
 
AN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly
enchanted; and, desiring to possess the same charms of melody,
demanded what sort of food they lived on to give them such
beautiful voices.  They replied, "The dew."  The Ass resolved that
he would live only upon dew, and in a short time died of hunger. 

 
The Lion and the Mouse 
 
A LION was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face. 
Rising up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when
the Mouse piteously entreated, saying:  "If you would only spare
my life, I would be sure to repay your kindness."  The Lion
laughed and let him go.  It happened shortly after this that the
Lion was caught by some hunters, who bound him by st ropes to the
ground.  The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came gnawed the rope
with his teeth, and set him free, exclaim 
 
"You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you,
expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor; I now
you know that it is possible for even a Mouse to con benefits on
a Lion."  
 

The Charcoal-Burner and the Fuller 
 
A CHARCOAL-BURNER carried on his trade in his own house.  One day
he met a friend, a Fuller, and entreated him to come and live
with him, saying that they should be far better neighbors and
that their housekeeping expenses would be lessened.  The Fuller
replied, "The arrangement is impossible as far as I am concerned,
for whatever I should whiten, you would immediately blacken again
with your charcoal."  
 
Like will draw like.   


The Father and His Sons 
 
A FATHER had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling
among themselves.  When he failed to heal their disputes by his
exhortations, he determined to give them a practical illustration
of the evils of disunion; and for this purpose he one day told
them to bring him a bundle of sticks.  When they had done so, he
placed the faggot into the hands of each of them in succession,
and ordered them to break it in pieces.  They tried with all
their strength, and were not able to do it.  He next opened the
faggot, took the sticks separately, one by one, and again put
them into his sons' hands, upon which they broke them easily.  He
then addressed them in these words:  "My sons, if you are of one
mind, and unite to assist each other, you will be as this faggot,
uninjured by all the attempts of your enemies; but if you are
divided among yourselves, you will be broken as easily as these
sticks."  
 

The Boy Hunting Locusts 
 
A BOY was hunting for locusts.  He had caught a goodly number,
when he saw a Scorpion, and mistaking him for a locust, reached
out his hand to take him.  The Scorpion, showing his sting, said:
If you had but touched me, my friend, you would have lost me, and
all your locusts too!"  
 

The Cock and the Jewel 
 
A COCK, scratching for food for himself and his hens, found a
precious stone and exclaimed:  "If your owner had found thee, and
not I, he would have taken thee up, and have set thee in thy
first estate; but I have found thee for no purpose.  I would
rather have one barleycorn than all the jewels in the world."  
 

The Kingdom of the Lion 
 
THE BEASTS of the field and forest had a Lion as their king.  He
was neither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but just and gentle
as a king could be.  During his reign he made a royal
proclamation for a general assembly of all the birds and beasts,
and drew up conditions for a universal league, in which the Wolf
and the Lamb, the Panther and the Kid, the Tiger and the Stag,
the Dog and the Hare, should live together in perfect peace and
amity.  The Hare said, "Oh, how I have longed to see this day, in
which the weak shall take their place with impunity by the side
of the strong."  And after the Hare said this, he ran for his
life.  
 

The Wolf and the Crane 
 
A WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a
large sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. 
When the Crane had extracted the bone and demanded the promised
payment, the Wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed:
"Why, you have surely already had a sufficient recompense, in
having been permitted to draw out your head in safety from the
mouth and jaws of a wolf."  
 
In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you
escape injury for your pains.  
 

The Fisherman Piping 
 
A FISHERMAN skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the
seashore.  Standing on a projecting rock, he played several tunes
in the hope that the fish, attracted by his melody, would of
their own accord dance into his net, which he had placed below. 
At last, having long waited in vain, he laid aside his flute, and
casting his net into the sea, made an excellent haul of fish. 
When he saw them leaping about in the net upon the rock he said:
"O you most perverse creatures, when I piped you would not dance,
but now that I have ceased you do so merrily."  
 

Hercules and the Wagoner 
 
A CARTER was driving a wagon along a country lane, when the
wheels sank down deep into a rut.  The rustic driver, stupefied
and aghast, stood looking at the wagon, and did nothing but utter
loud cries to Hercules to come and help him.  Hercules, it is
said, appeared and thus addressed him:  "Put your shoulders to the
wheels, my man.  Goad on your bullocks, and never more pray to me
for help, until you have done your best to help yourself, or
depend upon it you will henceforth pray in vain."  
 
Self-help is the best help.   


The Ants and the Grasshopper 
 
THE ANTS were spending a fine winter's day drying grain collected
in the summertime.  A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed
by and earnestly begged for a little food.  The Ants inquired of
him, "Why did you not treasure up food during the summer?'  He
replied, "I had not leisure enough.  I passed the days in
singing."  They then said in derision:  "If you were foolish enough
to sing all the summer, you must dance supperless to bed in the
winter."  
 

The Traveler and His Dog 
 
A TRAVELER about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the
door stretching himself.  He asked him sharply:  "Why do you stand
there gaping? Everything is ready but you, so come with me
instantly."  The Dog, wagging his tail, replied:  "O, master! I am
quite ready; it is you for whom I am waiting."  
 
The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend.  
 

The Dog and the Shadow 
 
A DOG, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in
his mouth, saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that
of another Dog, with a piece of meat double his own in size.  He
immediately let go of his own, and fiercely attacked the other
Dog to get his larger piece from him.  He thus lost both:  that
which he grasped at in the water, because it was a shadow; and
his own, because the stream swept it away.  
 

The Mole and His Mother 
 
A MOLE, a creature blind from birth, once said to his Mother:  "I
am sure than I can see, Mother!"  In the desire to prove to him
his mistake, his Mother placed before him a few grains of
frankincense, and asked, "What is it?'  The young Mole said, "It
is a pebble."  His Mother exclaimed:  "My son, I am afraid that you
are not only blind, but that you have lost your sense of smell.  
 

The Herdsman and the Lost Bull 
 
A HERDSMAN tending his flock in a forest lost a Bull-calf from
the fold.  After a long and fruitless search, he made a vow that,
if he could only discover the thief who had stolen the Calf, he
would offer a lamb in sacrifice to Hermes, Pan, and the Guardian
Deities of the forest.  Not long afterwards, as he ascended a
small hillock, he saw at its foot a Lion feeding on the Calf. 
Terrified at the sight, he lifted his eyes and his hands to
heaven, and said:  "Just now I vowed to offer a lamb to the
Guardian Deities of the forest if I could only find out who had
robbed me; but now that I have discovered the thief, I would
willingly add a full-grown Bull to the Calf I have lost, if I may
only secure my own escape from him in safety."  
 

The Hare and the Tortoise 
 
A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the
Tortoise, who replied, laughing:  "Though you be swift as the
wind, I will beat you in a race."  The Hare, believing her
assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and
they agreed that the Fox should choose the course and fix the
goal.  On the day appointed for the race the two started
together.  The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on
with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. 
The Hare, lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep.  At last
waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise
had reached the goal, and was comfortably dozing after her
fatigue.  
 
Slow but steady wins the race.  
 

The Pomegranate, Apple-Tree, and Bramble 
 
THE POMEGRANATE and Apple-Tree disputed as to which was the most
beautiful.  When their strife was at its height, a Bramble from
the neighboring hedge lifted up its voice, and said in a boastful
tone:  "Pray, my dear friends, in my presence at least cease from
such vain disputings."  
 

The Farmer and the Stork 
 
A FARMER placed nets on his newly-sown plowlands and caught a
number of Cranes, which came to pick up his seed.  With them he
trapped a Stork that had fractured his leg in the net and was
earnestly beseeching the Farmer to spare his life.  "Pray save
me, Master," he said, "and let me go free this once.  My broken
limb should excite your pity.  Besides, I am no Crane, I am a
Stork, a bird of excellent character; and see how I love and
slave for my father and mother.  Look too, at my feathers--
they are not the least like those of a Crane."   The Farmer 
laughed aloud and said, "It may be all as you say, I only know 
this:  I have taken you with these robbers, the Cranes, and you 
must die in their company."  
 
Birds of a feather flock together.   


The Farmer and the Snake 
 
ONE WINTER a Farmer found a Snake stiff and frozen with cold.  He
had compassion on it, and taking it up, placed it in his bosom. 
The Snake was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its
natural instincts, bit its benefactor, inflicting on him a mortal
wound.  "Oh," cried the Farmer with his last breath, "I am
rightly served for pitying a scoundrel."  
 
The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.  
 

The Fawn and His Mother 
 
A YOUNG FAWN once said to his Mother, "You are larger than a dog,
and swifter, and more used to running, and you have your horns as
a defense; why, then, O Mother! do the hounds frighten you so?"
She smiled, and said:  "I know full well, my son, that all you say
is true.  I have the advantages you mention, but when I hear even
the bark of a single dog I feel ready to faint, and fly away as
fast as I can."  
 
No arguments will give courage to the coward.  
 

The Bear and the Fox 
 
A BEAR boasted very much of his philanthropy, saying that of all
animals he was the most tender in his regard for man, for he had
such respect for him that he would not even touch his dead body. 
A Fox hearing these words said with a smile to the Bear, "Oh!
that you would eat the dead and not the living."  
 

The Swallow and the Crow 
 
THE SWALLOW and the Crow had a contention about their plumage. 
The Crow put an end to the dispute by saying, "Your feathers are
all very well in the spring, but mine protect me against the
winter."  
 
Fair weather friends are not worth much.  
 

The Mountain in Labor 
 
A MOUNTAIN was once greatly agitated.  Loud groans and noises
were heard, and crowds of people came from all parts to see what
was the matter.  While they were assembled in anxious expectation
of some terrible calamity, out came a Mouse.  
 
Don't make much ado about nothing.  
 

The Ass, the Fox, and the Lion 
 
THE ASS and the Fox, having entered into partnership together for
their mutual protection, went out into the forest to hunt.  They
had not proceeded far when they met a Lion.  The Fox, seeing
imminent danger, approached the Lion and promised to contrive for
him the capture of the Ass if the Lion would pledge his word not
to harm the Fox.  Then, upon assuring the Ass that he would not
be injured, the Fox led him to a deep pit and arranged that he
should fall into it.  The Lion, seeing that the Ass was secured,
immediately clutched the Fox, and attacked the Ass at his
leisure.  
 

The Tortoise and the Eagle  

A TORTOISE, lazily basking in the sun, complained to the
sea-birds of her hard fate, that no one would teach her to fly. 
An Eagle, hovering near, heard her lamentation and demanded what
reward she would give him if he would take her aloft and float
her in the air.  "I will give you," she said, "all the riches of
the Red Sea."  "I will teach you to fly then," said the Eagle; and
taking her up in his talons he carried her almost to the clouds 
suddenly he let her go, and she fell on a lofty mountain, dashing
her shell to pieces.  The Tortoise exclaimed in the moment of
death:  "I have deserved my present fate; for what had I to do
with wings and clouds, who can with difficulty move about on the
earth?'  
 
If men had all they wished, they would be often ruined.   


The Flies and the Honey-Pot 
 
A NUMBER of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been
overturned in a housekeeper's room, and placing their feet in it,
ate greedily.  Their feet, however, became so smeared with the
honey that they could not use their wings, nor release
themselves, and were suffocated.  Just as they were expiring,
they exclaimed, "O foolish creatures that we are, for the sake of
a little pleasure we have destroyed ourselves."  
 
Pleasure bought with pains, hurts.  
 

The Man and the Lion 
 
A MAN and a Lion traveled together through the forest.  They soon
began to boast of their respective superiority to each other in
strength and prowess.  As they were disputing, they passed a
statue carved in stone, which represented "a Lion strangled by a
Man."  The traveler pointed to it and said:  "See there! How strong
we are, and how we prevail over even the king of beasts."  The
Lion replied:  "This statue was made by one of you men.  If we
Lions knew how to erect statues, you would see the Man placed
under the paw of the Lion."  
 
One story is good, till another is told.  
 

The Farmer and the Cranes 
 
SOME CRANES made their feeding grounds on some plowlands newly
sown with wheat.  For a long time the Farmer, brandishing an
empty sling, chased them away by the terror he inspired; but when
the birds found that the sling was only swung in the air, they
ceased to take any notice of it and would not move.  The Farmer,
on seeing this, charged his sling with stones, and killed a great
number.  The remaining birds at once forsook his fields, crying
to each other, "It is time for us to be off to Liliput:  for this
man is no longer content to scare us, but begins to show us in
earnest what he can do."  
 
If words suffice not, blows must follow.  
 

The Dog in the Manger 
 
A DOG lay in a manger, and by his growling and snapping prevented
the oxen from eating the hay which had been placed for them. 
"What a selfish Dog!"  said one of them to his companions; "he
cannot eat the hay himself, and yet refuses to allow those to eat
who can."  
 

The Fox and the Goat 
 
A FOX one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of
escape.  A Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and
seeing the Fox, inquired if the water was good.  Concealing his
sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish
praise of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and
encouraging him to descend.  The Goat, mindful only of his
thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Fox
informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a
scheme for their common escape.  "If," said he, "you will place
your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up
your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards."  The Goat
readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back.  Steadying
himself with the Goat's horns, he safely reached the mouth of the
well and made off as fast as he could.  When the Goat upbraided
him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out,
"You foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your head
as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down
before you had inspected the way up, nor have exposed yourself to
dangers from which you had no means of escape."  
 
Look before you leap.  
 

The Bear and the Two Travelers 
 
TWO MEN were traveling together, when a Bear suddenly met them on
their path.  One of them climbed up quickly into a tree and
concealed himself in the branches.  The other, seeing that he
must be attacked, fell flat on the ground, and when the Bear came
up and felt him with his snout, and smelt him all over, he held
his breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he
could.  The Bear soon left him, for it is said he will not touch
a dead body.  When he was quite gone, the other Traveler
descended from the tree, and jocularly inquired of his friend
what it was the Bear had whispered in his ear.  "He gave me this
advice," his companion replied.  "Never travel with a friend who
deserts you at the approach of danger."  
 
Misfortune tests the sincerity of friends.  
 

The Oxen and the Axle-Trees 
 
A HEAVY WAGON was being dragged along a country lane by a team of
Oxen.  The Axle-trees groaned and creaked terribly; whereupon the
Oxen, turning round, thus addressed the wheels:  "Hullo there! why
do you make so much noise? We bear all the labor, and we, not
you, ought to cry out."  
 
Those who suffer most cry out the least.  
 

The Thirsty Pigeon 
 
A PIGEON, oppressed by excessive thirst, saw a goblet of water
painted on a signboard.  Not supposing it to be only a picture,
she flew towards it with a loud whir and unwittingly dashed
against the signboard, jarring herself terribly.  Having broken
her wings by the blow, she fell to the ground, and was caught by
one of the bystanders.  
 
Zeal should not outrun discretion.  
 

The Raven and the Swan 
 
A RAVEN saw a Swan and desired to secure for himself the same
beautiful plumage.  Supposing that the Swan's splendid white
color arose from his washing in the water in which he swam, the
Raven left the altars in the neighborhood where he picked up his
living, and took up residence in the lakes and pools.  But
cleansing his feathers as often as he would, he could not change
their color, while through want of food he perished.  
 
Change of habit cannot alter Nature.  
 

The Goat and the Goatherd 
 
A GOATHERD had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock. 
He whistled and sounded his horn in vain; the straggler paid no
attention to the summons.  At last the Goatherd threw a stone,
and breaking its horn, begged the Goat not to tell his master. 
The Goat replied, "Why, you silly fellow, the horn will speak
though I be silent."  
 
Do not attempt to hide things which cannot be hid.  
 

The Miser 
 
A MISER sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold, which he
buried in a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and
went to look at daily.  One of his workmen observed his frequent
visits to the spot and decided to watch his movements.  He soon
discovered the secret of the hidden treasure, and digging down,
came to the lump of gold, and stole it.  The Miser, on his next
visit, found the hole empty and began to tear his hair and to
make loud lamentations.  A neighbor, seeing him overcome with
grief and learning the cause, said, "Pray do not grieve so; but
go and take a stone, and place it in the hole, and fancy that the
gold is still lying there.  It will do you quite the same
service; for when the gold was there, you had it not, as you did
not make the slightest use of it."  
 

The Sick Lion 
 
A LION, unable from old age and infirmities to provide himself
with food by force, resolved to do so by artifice.  He returned
to his den, and lying down there, pretended to be sick, taking
care that his sickness should be publicly known.  The beasts
expressed their sorrow, and came one by one to his den, where the
Lion devoured them.  After many of the beasts had thus
disappeared, the Fox discovered the trick and presenting himself
to the Lion, stood on the outside of the cave, at a respectful
distance, and asked him how he was.  "I am very middling,"
replied the Lion, "but why do you stand without? Pray enter
within to talk with me."  "No, thank you," said the Fox.  "I
notice that there are many prints of feet entering your cave, but
I see no trace of any returning."  
 
He is wise who is warned by the misfortunes of others.  
 

The Horse and Groom 
 
A GROOM used to spend whole days in currycombing and rubbing down
his Horse, but at the same time stole his oats and sold them for
his own profit.  "Alas!"  said the Horse, "if you really wish me
to be in good condition, you should groom me less, and feed me
more."  
 

The Ass and the Lapdog 
 
A MAN had an Ass, and a Maltese Lapdog, a very great beauty.  The
Ass was left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eat,
just as any other Ass would.  The Lapdog knew many tricks and was
a great favorite with his master, who often fondled him and
seldom went out to dine without bringing him home some tidbit to
eat.  The Ass, on the contrary, had much work to do in grinding
the corn-mill and in carrying wood from the forest or burdens
from the farm.  He often lamented his own hard fate and
contrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the Lapdog, till at
last one day he broke his cords and halter, and galloped into his
master's house, kicking up his heels without measure, and
frisking and fawning as well as he could.  He next tried to jump
about his master as he had seen the Lapdog do, but he broke the
table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms.  He then
attempted to lick his master, and jumped upon his back.  The
servants, hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of
their master, quickly relieved him, and drove out the Ass to his
stable with kicks and clubs and cuffs.  The Ass, as he returned
to his stall beaten nearly to death, thus lamented:  "I have
brought it all on myself! Why could I not have been contented to
labor with my companions, and not wish to be idle all the day
like that useless little Lapdog!"  
 

The Lioness 
 
A CONTROVERSY prevailed among the beasts of the field as to which
of the animals deserved the most credit for producing the
greatest number of whelps at a birth.  They rushed clamorously
into the presence of the Lioness and demanded of her the
settlement of the dispute.  "And you," they said, "how many sons
have you at a birth?'  The Lioness laughed at them, and said:
"Why! I have only one; but that one is altogether a thoroughbred
Lion."  
 
The value is in the worth, not in the number.  
 

The Boasting Traveler 
 
A MAN who had traveled in foreign lands boasted very much, on
returning to his own country, of the many wonderful and heroic
feats he had performed in the different places he had visited. 
Among other things, he said that when he was at Rhodes he had
leaped to such a distance that no man of his day could leap
anywhere near him as to that, there were in Rhodes many persons 
who saw him do it and whom he could call as witnesses.  One of 
the bystanders interrupted him, saying:  "Now, my good man, if 
this be all true there is no need of witnesses.  Suppose this 
to be Rhodes, and leap for us."  
 

The Cat and the Cock 
 
A CAT caught a Cock, and pondered how he might find a reasonable
excuse for eating him.  He accused him of being a nuisance to men
by crowing in the nighttime and not permitting them to sleep. 
The Cock defended himself by saying that he did this for the
benefit of men, that they might rise in time for their labors. 
The Cat replied, "Although you abound in specious apologies, I
shall not remain supperless"; and he made a meal of him.  
 

The Piglet, the Sheep, and the Goat 
 
A YOUNG PIG was shut up in a fold-yard with a Goat and a Sheep. 
On one occasion when the shepherd laid hold of him, he grunted
and squeaked and resisted violently.  The Sheep and the Goat
complained of his distressing cries, saying, "He often handles
us, and we do not cry out."  To this the Pig replied, "Your
handling and mine are very different things.  He catches you only
for your wool, or your milk, but he lays hold on me for my very
life."  
 

The Boy and the Filberts 
 
A BOY put his hand into a pitcher full of filberts.  He grasped
as many as he could possibly hold, but when he tried to pull out
his hand, he was prevented from doing so by the neck of the
pitcher.  Unwilling to lose his filberts, and yet unable to
withdraw his hand, he burst into tears and bitterly lamented his
disappointment.  A bystander said to him, "Be satisfied with half
the quantity, and you will readily draw out your hand."  
 
Do not attempt too much at once.  
 

The Lion in Love 
 
A LION demanded the daughter of a woodcutter in marriage.  The
Father, unwilling to grant, and yet afraid to refuse his request,
hit upon this expedient to rid himself of his importunities.  He
expressed his willingness to accept the Lion as the suitor of his
daughter on one condition:  that he should allow him to extract
his teeth, and cut off his claws, as his daughter was fearfully
afraid of both.  The Lion cheerfully assented to the proposal. 
But when the toothless, clawless Lion returned to repeat his
request, the Woodman, no longer afraid, set upon him with his
club, and drove him away into the forest.  
 

The Laborer and the Snake 
 
A SNAKE, having made his hole close to the porch of a cottage,
inflicted a mortal bite on the Cottager's infant son.  Grieving
over his loss, the Father resolved to kill the Snake.  The next
day, when it came out of its hole for food, he took up his axe,
but by swinging too hastily, missed its head and cut off only the
end of its tail.  After some time the Cottager, afraid that the
Snake would bite him also, endeavored to make peace, and placed
some bread and salt in the hole.  The Snake, slightly hissing,
said:  "There can henceforth be no peace between us; for whenever
I see you I shall remember the loss of my tail, and whenever you
see me you will be thinking of the death of your son."  
 
No one truly forgets injuries in the presence of him who caused
the injury.  
 

The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing 
 
ONCE UPON A TIME a Wolf resolved to disguise his appearance in
order to secure food more easily.  Encased in the skin of a
sheep, he pastured with the flock deceiving the shepherd by his
costume.  In the evening he was shut up by the shepherd in the
fold; the gate was closed, and the entrance made thoroughly
secure.  But the shepherd, returning to the fold during the night
to obtain meat for the next day, mistakenly caught up the Wolf
instead of a sheep, and killed him instantly.  
 
Harm seek.  harm find.  
 

The Ass and the Mule 
 
A MULETEER set forth on a journey, driving before him an Ass and
a Mule, both well laden.  The Ass, as long as he traveled along
the plain, carried his load with ease, but when he began to
ascend the steep path of the mountain, felt his load to be more
than he could bear.  He entreated his companion to relieve him of
a small portion, that he might carry home the rest; but the Mule
paid no attention to the request.  The Ass shortly afterwards
fell down dead under his burden.  Not knowing what else to do in
so wild a region, the Muleteer placed upon the Mule the load
carried by the Ass in addition to his own, and at the top of all
placed the hide of the Ass, after he had skinned him.  The Mule,
groaning beneath his heavy burden, said to himself:  "I am treated
according to my deserts.  If I had only been willing to assist
the Ass a little in his need, I should not now be bearing,
together with his burden, himself as well."  
 

The Frogs Asking for a King 
 
THE FROGS, grieved at having no established Ruler, sent
ambassadors to Jupiter entreating for a King.  Perceiving their
simplicity, he cast down a huge log into the lake.  The Frogs
were terrified at the splash occasioned by its fall and hid
themselves in the depths of the pool.  But as soon as they
realized that the huge log was motionless, they swam again to the
top of the water, dismissed their fears, climbed up, and began
squatting on it in contempt.  After some time they began to think
themselves ill-treated in the appointment of so inert a Ruler,
and sent a second deputation to Jupiter to pray that he would set
over them another sovereign.  He then gave them an Eel to govern
them.  When the Frogs discovered his easy good nature, they sent
yet a third time to Jupiter to beg him to choose for them still
another King.  Jupiter, displeased with all their complaints,
sent a Heron, who preyed upon the Frogs day by day till there
were none left to croak upon the lake.  
 

The Boys and the Frogs 
 
SOME BOYS, playing near a pond, saw a number of Frogs in the
water and began to pelt them with stones.  They killed several of
them, when one of the Frogs, lifting his head out of the water,
cried out:  "Pray stop, my boys:  what is sport to you, is death to
us."  
 

The Sick Stag 
 
A SICK STAG lay down in a quiet corner of its pasture-ground. 
His companions came in great numbers to inquire after his health,
and each one helped himself to a share of the food which had been
placed for his use; so that he died, not from his sickness, but
from the failure of the means of living.  
 
Evil companions bring more hurt than profit.  
 

The Salt Merchant and His Ass 
 
A PEDDLER drove his Ass to the seashore to buy salt.  His road
home lay across a stream into which his Ass, making a false step,
fell by accident and rose up again with his load considerably
lighter, as the water melted the sack.  The Peddler retraced his
steps and refilled his panniers with a larger quantity of salt
than before.  When he came again to the stream, the Ass fell down
on purpose in the same spot, and, regaining his feet with the
weight of his load much diminished, brayed triumphantly as if he
had obtained what he desired.  The Peddler saw through his trick
and drove him for the third time to the coast, where he bought a
cargo of sponges instead of salt.  The Ass, again playing the
fool, fell down on purpose when he reached the stream, but the
sponges became swollen with water, greatly increasing his load. 
And thus his trick recoiled on him, for he now carried on his
back a double burden.  
 

The Oxen and the Butchers 
 
THE OXEN once upon a time sought to destroy the Butchers, who
practiced a trade destructive to their race.  They assembled on a
certain day to carry out their purpose, and sharpened their horns
for the contest.  But one of them who was exceedingly old (for
many a field had he plowed) thus spoke:  "These Butchers, it is
true, slaughter us, but they do so with skillful hands, and with
no unnecessary pain.  If we get rid of them, we shall fall into
the hands of unskillful operators, and thus suffer a double
death:  for you may be assured, that though all the Butchers
should perish, yet will men never want beef."  
 
Do not be in a hurry to change one evil for another.  
 

The Lion, the Mouse, and the Fox 
 
A LION, fatigued by the heat of a summer's day, fell fast asleep
in his den.  A Mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him from
his slumbers.  He rose up and shook himself in great wrath, and
searched every corner of his den to find the Mouse.  A Fox seeing
him said:  "A fine Lion you are, to be frightened of a Mouse."
"'Tis not the Mouse I fear," said the Lion; "I resent his
familiarity and ill-breeding."  
 
Little liberties are great offenses.  
 

The Vain Jackdaw 
 
JUPITER DETERMINED, it is said, to create a sovereign over the
birds, and made proclamation that on a certain day they should
all present themselves before him, when he would himself choose
the most beautiful among them to be king.  The Jackdaw, knowing
his own ugliness, searched through the woods and fields, and
collected the feathers which had fallen from the wings of his
companions, and stuck them in all parts of his body, hoping
thereby to make himself the most beautiful of all.  When the
appointed day arrived, and the birds had assembled before
Jupiter, the Jackdaw also made his appearance in his many
feathered finery.  But when Jupiter proposed to make him king
because of the beauty of his plumage, the birds indignantly
protested, and each plucked from him his own feathers, leaving
the Jackdaw nothing but a Jackdaw.  
 

The Goatherd and the Wild Goats 
 
A GOATHERD, driving his flock from their pasture at eventide,
found some Wild Goats mingled among them, and shut them up
together with his own for the night.  The next day it snowed very
hard, so that he could not take the herd to their usual feeding
places, but was obliged to keep them in the fold.  He gave his
own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive, but fed the
strangers more abundantly in the hope of enticing them to stay
with him and of making them his own.  When the thaw set in, he
led them all out to feed, and the Wild Goats scampered away as
fast as they could to the mountains.  The Goatherd scolded them
for their ingratitude in leaving him, when during the storm he
had taken more care of them than of his own herd.  One of them,
turning about, said to him:  "That is the very reason why we are
so cautious; for if you yesterday treated us better than the
Goats you have had so long, it is plain also that if others came
after us, you would in the same manner prefer them to ourselves."

 
Old friends cannot with impunity be sacrificed for new ones.  
 

The Mischievous Dog 
 
A DOG used to run up quietly to the heels of everyone he met, and
to bite them without notice.  His master suspended a bell about
his neck so that the Dog might give notice of his presence
wherever he went.  Thinking it a mark of distinction, the Dog
grew proud of his bell and went tinkling it all over the
marketplace.  One day an old hound said to him:  Why do you make
such an exhibition of yourself? That bell that you carry is not,
believe me, any order of merit, but on the contrary a mark of
disgrace, a public notice to all men to avoid you as an ill
mannered dog."  
 
Notoriety is often mistaken for fame.  
 

The Fox Who Had Lost His Tail 
 
A FOX caught in a trap escaped, but in so doing lost his tail. 
Thereafter, feeling his life a burden from the shame and ridicule
to which he was exposed, he schemed to convince all the other
Foxes that being tailless was much more attractive, thus making
up for his own deprivation.  He assembled a good many Foxes and
publicly advised them to cut off their tails, saying that they
would not only look much better without them, but that they would
get rid of the weight of the brush, which was a very great
inconvenience.  One of them interrupting him said, "If you had
not yourself lost your tail, my friend, you would not thus
counsel us."  
 

The Boy and the Nettles 
 
A BOY was stung by a Nettle.  He ran home and told his Mother,
saying, "Although it hurts me very much, I only touched it
gently."  "That was just why it stung you," said his Mother.  "The
next time you touch a Nettle, grasp it boldly, and it will be
soft as silk to your hand, and not in the least hurt you."  
 
Whatever you do, do with all your might.  
 

The Man and His Two Sweethearts 
 
A MIDDLE-AGED MAN, whose hair had begun to turn gray, courted two
women at the same time.  One of them was young, and the other
well advanced in years.  The elder woman, ashamed to be courted
by a man younger than herself, made a point, whenever her admirer
visited her, to pull out some portion of his black hairs.  The
younger, on the contrary, not wishing to become the wife of an
old man, was equally zealous in removing every gray hair she
could find.  Thus it came to pass that between them both he very
soon found that he had not a hair left on his head.  
 
Those who seek to please everybody please nobody.  
 

The Astronomer 
 
AN ASTRONOMER used to go out at night to observe the stars.  One
evening, as he wandered through the suburbs with his whole
attention fixed on the sky, he fell accidentally into a deep
well.  While he lamented and bewailed his sores and bruises, and
cried loudly for help, a neighbor ran to the well, and learning
what had happened said:  "Hark ye, old fellow, why, in striving to
pry into what is in heaven, do you not manage to see what is on
earth?'  
 

The Wolves and the Sheep 
 
"WHY SHOULD there always be this fear and slaughter between us?"
said the Wolves to the Sheep.  "Those evil-disposed Dogs have
much to answer for.  They always bark whenever we approach you
and attack us before we have done any harm.  If you would only
dismiss them from your heels, there might soon be treaties of
peace and reconciliation between us."  The Sheep, poor silly
creatures, were easily beguiled and dismissed the Dogs, whereupon
the Wolves destroyed the unguarded flock at their own pleasure.  
 

The Old Woman and the Physician 
 
AN OLD WOMAN having lost the use of her eyes, called in a
Physician to heal them, and made this bargain with him in the
presence of witnesses:  that if he should cure her blindness, he
should receive from her a sum of money; but if her infirmity
remained, she should give him nothing.  This agreement being
made, the Physician, time after time, applied his salve to her
eyes, and on every visit took something away, stealing all her
property little by little.  And when he had got all she had, he
healed her and demanded the promised payment.  The Old Woman,
when she recovered her sight and saw none of her goods in her
house, would give him nothing.  The Physician insisted on his
claim, and.  as she still refused, summoned her before the Judge. 
The Old Woman, standing up in the Court, argued:  "This man here
speaks the truth in what he says; for I did promise to give him a
sum of money if I should recover my sight:  but if I continued
blind, I was to give him nothing.  Now he declares that I am
healed.  I on the contrary affirm that I am still blind; for when
I lost the use of my eyes, I saw in my house various chattels and
valuable goods:  but now, though he swears I am cured of my
blindness, I am not able to see a single thing in it."  
 

The Fighting Cocks and the Eagle 
 
TWO GAME COCKS were fiercely fighting for the mastery of the
farmyard.  One at last put the other to flight.  The vanquished
Cock skulked away and hid himself in a quiet corner, while the
conqueror, flying up to a high wall, flapped his wings and crowed
exultingly with all his might.  An Eagle sailing through the air
pounced upon him and carried him off in his talons.  The
vanquished Cock immediately came out of his corner, and ruled
henceforth with undisputed mastery.  
 
Pride goes before destruction.  
 

The Charger and the Miller 
 
A CHARGER, feeling the infirmities of age, was sent to work in a
mill instead of going out to battle.  But when he was compelled
to grind instead of serving in the wars, he bewailed his change
of fortune and called to mind his former state, saying, "Ah!
Miller, I had indeed to go campaigning before, but I was barbed
from counter to tail, and a man went along to groom me; and now I
cannot understand what ailed me to prefer the mill before the
battle."  "Forbear," said the Miller to him, "harping on what was
of yore, for it is the common lot of mortals to sustain the ups
and downs of fortune."  
 

The Fox and the Monkey 
 
A MONKEY once danced in an assembly of the Beasts, and so pleased
them all by his performance that they elected him their King.  A
Fox, envying him the honor, discovered a piece of meat lying in a
trap, and leading the Monkey to the place where it was, said that
she had found a store, but had not used it  e had kept it for him
as treasure trove of his kingdom, and counseled him to lay hold
of it.  The Monkey approached carelessly and was caught in the
trap; and on his accusing the Fox of purposely leading him into
the snare, she replied, "O Monkey, and are you, with such a mind
as yours, going to be King over the Beasts?"
 

The Horse and His Rider 
 
A HORSE SOLDIER took the utmost pains with his charger.  As long
as the war lasted, he looked upon him as his fellow-helper in all
emergencies and fed him carefully with hay and corn.  But when
the war was over, he only allowed him chaff to eat and made him
carry heavy loads of wood, subjecting him to much slavish
drudgery and ill-treatment.  War was again proclaimed, however,
and when the trumpet summoned him to his standard, the Soldier
put on his charger its military trappings, and mounted, being
clad in his heavy coat of mail.  The Horse fell down straightway
under the weight, no longer equal to the burden, and said to his
master, "You must now go to the war on foot, for you have
transformed me from a Horse into an Ass; and how can you expect
that I can again turn in a moment from an Ass to a Horse?'  
 

The Belly and the Members 
 
THE MEMBERS of the Body rebelled against the Belly, and said,
"Why should we be perpetually engaged in administering to your
wants, while you do nothing but take your rest, and enjoy
yourself in luxury and self-indulgence?'  The Members carried out
their resolve and refused their assistance to the Belly.  The
whole Body quickly became debilitated, and the hands, feet,
mouth, and eyes, when too late, repented of their folly.  
 

The Vine and the Goat 
 
A VINE was luxuriant in the time of vintage with leaves and
grapes.  A Goat, passing by, nibbled its young tendrils and its
leaves.  The Vine addressed him and said:  "Why do you thus injure
me without a cause, and crop my leaves? Is there no young grass
left? But I shall not have to wait long for my just revenge; for
if you now should crop my leaves, and cut me down to my root, I
shall provide the wine to pour over you when you are led as a
victim to the sacrifice."  
 

Jupiter and the Monkey 
 
JUPITER ISSUED a proclamation to all the beasts of the forest and
promised a royal reward to the one whose offspring should be
deemed the handsomest.  The Monkey came with the rest and
presented, with all a mother's tenderness, a flat-nosed,
hairless, ill-featured young Monkey as a candidate for the
promised reward.  A general laugh saluted her on the presentation
of her son.  She resolutely said, "I know not whether Jupiter
will allot the prize to my son, but this I do know, that he is at
least in the eyes of me his mother, the dearest, handsomest, and
most beautiful of all."  
 

The Widow and Her Little Maidens 
 
A WIDOW who was fond of cleaning had two little maidens to wait
on her.  She was in the habit of waking them early in the
morning, at cockcrow.  The maidens, aggravated by such excessive
labor, resolved to kill the cock who roused their mistress so
early.  When they had done this, they found that they had only
prepared for themselves greater troubles, for their mistress, no
longer hearing the hour from the cock, woke them up to their work
in the middle of the night.  
 

The Shepherd's Boy and the Wolf 
 
A SHEPHERD-BOY, who watched a flock of sheep near a village,
brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out,
"Wolf! Wolf!"  and when his neighbors came to help him, laughed at
them for their pains.  The Wolf, however, did truly come at last. 
The Shepherd-boy, now really alarmed, shouted in an agony of
terror:  "Pray, do come and help me; the Wolf is killing the
sheep"; but no one paid any heed to his cries, nor rendered any
assistance.  The Wolf, having no cause of fear, at his leisure
lacerated or destroyed the whole flock.  
 
There is no believing a liar, even when he speaks the truth.  
 

The Cat and the Birds 
 
A CAT, hearing that the Birds in a certain aviary were ailing
dressed himself up as a physician, and, taking his cane and a bag
of instruments becoming his profession, went to call on them.  He
knocked at the door and inquired of the inmates how they all did,
saying that if they were ill, he would be happy to prescribe for
them and cure them.  They replied, "We are all very well, and
shall continue so, if you will only be good enough to go away,
and leave us as we are."  
 

The Kid and the Wolf 
 
A KID standing on the roof of a house, out of harm's way, saw a
Wolf passing by and immediately began to taunt and revile him. 
The Wolf, looking up, said, "Sirrah! I hear thee:  yet it is not
thou who mockest me, but the roof on which thou art standing."  
 
Time and place often give the advantage to the weak over the
strong.  
 

The Ox and the Frog 
 
AN OX drinking at a pool trod on a brood of young frogs and
crushed one of them to death.  The Mother coming up, and missing
one of her sons, inquired of his brothers what had become of him. 
"He is dead, dear Mother; for just now a very huge beast with
four great feet came to the pool and crushed him to death with
his cloven heel."  The Frog, puffing herself out, inquired, "if
the beast was as big as that in size."  "Cease, Mother, to puff
yourself out," said her son, "and do not be angry; for you would,
I assure you, sooner burst than successfully imitate the hugeness
of that monster."  
 

The Shepherd and the Wolf 
 
 A SHEPHERD once found the whelp of a Wolf and brought it up, and
after a while taught it to steal lambs from the neighboring
flocks.  The Wolf, having shown himself an apt pupil, said to the
Shepherd, "Since you have taught me to steal, you must keep a
sharp lookout, or you will lose some of your own flock."  
 

The Father and His Two Daughters 
 
A MAN had two daughters, the one married to a gardener, and the
other to a tile-maker.  After a time he went to the daughter who
had married the gardener, and inquired how she was and how all
things went with her.  She said, "All things are prospering with
me, and I have only one wish, that there may be a heavy fall of
rain, in order that the plants may be well watered."  Not long
after, he went to the daughter who had married the tilemaker, and
likewise inquired of her how she fared; she replied, "I want for
nothing, and have only one wish, that the dry weather may
continue, and the sun shine hot and bright, so that the bricks
might be dried."  He said to her, "If your sister wishes for rain,
and you for dry weather, with which of the two am I to join my
wishes?'  
 

The Farmer and His Sons 
 
A FATHER, being on the point of death, wished to be sure that his
sons would give the same attention to his farm as he himself had
given it.  He called them to his bedside and said, "My sons,
there is a great treasure hid in one of my vineyards."  The sons,
after his death, took their spades and mattocks and carefully dug
over every portion of their land.  They found no treasure, but
the vines repaid their labor by an extraordinary and
superabundant crop.  
 

The Crab and Its Mother 
 
A CRAB said to her son, "Why do you walk so one-sided, my child?
It is far more becoming to go straight forward."  The young Crab
replied:  "Quite true, dear Mother; and if you will show me the
straight way, I will promise to walk in it."  The Mother tried in
vain, and submitted without remonstrance to the reproof of her
child.  
 
Example is more powerful than precept.  
 

The Heifer and the Ox 
 
A HEIFER saw an Ox hard at work harnessed to a plow, and
tormented him with reflections on his unhappy fate in being
compelled to labor.  Shortly afterwards, at the harvest festival,
the owner released the Ox from his yoke, but bound the Heifer
with cords and led him away to the altar to be slain in honor of
the occasion.  The Ox saw what was being done, and said with a
smile to the Heifer:  "For this you were allowed to live in
idleness, because you were presently to be sacrificed."  
 

The Swallow, the Serpent, and the Court of Justice 
 
A SWALLOW, returning from abroad and especially fond of dwelling
with men, built herself a nest in the wall of a Court of Justice
and there hatched seven young birds.  A Serpent gliding past the
nest from its hole in the wall ate up the young unfledged
nestlings.  The Swallow, finding her nest empty, lamented greatly
and exclaimed:  "Woe to me a stranger! that in this place where
all others' rights are protected, I alone should suffer wrong."  
 

The Thief and His Mother 
 
A BOY stole a lesson-book from one of his schoolfellows and took
it home to his Mother.  She not only abstained from beating him,
but encouraged him.  He next time stole a cloak and brought it to
her, and she again commended him.  The Youth, advanced to
adulthood, proceeded to steal things of still greater value.  At
last he was caught in the very act, and having his hands bound
behind him, was led away to the place of public execution.  His
Mother followed in the crowd and violently beat her breast in
sorrow, whereupon the young man said, "I wish to say something to
my Mother in her ear."  She came close to him, and he quickly
seized her ear with his teeth and bit it off.  The Mother
upbraided him as an unnatural child, whereon he replied, "Ah! if
you had beaten me when I first stole and brought to you that
lesson-book, I should not have come to this, nor have been thus
led to a disgraceful death."  
 

The Old Man and Death 
 
AN OLD MAN was employed in cutting wood in the forest, and, in
carrying the faggots to the city for sale one day, became very
wearied with his long journey.  He sat down by the wayside, and
throwing down his load, besought "Death" to come.  "Death"
immediately appeared in answer to his summons and asked for what
reason he had called him.  The Old Man hurriedly replied, "That,
lifting up the load, you may place it again upon my shoulders."  
 

The Fir-Tree and the Bramble 
 
A FIR-TREE said boastingly to the Bramble, "You are useful for
nothing at all; while I am everywhere used for roofs and houses."
The Bramble answered:  'You poor creature, if you would only call
to mind the axes and saws which are about to hew you down, you
would have reason to wish that you had grown up a Bramble, not a
Fir-Tree."  
 
Better poverty without care, than riches with.  
 

The Mouse, the Frog, and the Hawk 
 
A MOUSE who always lived on the land, by an unlucky chance formed
an intimate acquaintance with a Frog, who lived for the most part
in the water.  The Frog, one day intent on mischief, bound the
foot of the Mouse tightly to his own.  Thus joined together, the
Frog first of all led his friend the Mouse to the meadow where
they were accustomed to find their food.  After this, he
gradually led him towards the pool in which he lived, until
reaching the very brink, he suddenly jumped in, dragging the
Mouse with him.  The Frog enjoyed the water amazingly, and swam
croaking about, as if he had done a good deed.  The unhappy Mouse
was soon suffocated by the water, and his dead body floated about
on the surface, tied to the foot of the Frog.  A Hawk observed
it, and, pouncing upon it with his talons, carried it aloft.  The
Frog, being still fastened to the leg of the Mouse, was also
carried off a prisoner, and was eaten by the Hawk.  
 
Harm hatch, harm catch.  
 

The Man Bitten by a Dog 
 
A MAN who had been bitten by a Dog went about in quest of someone
who might heal him.  A friend, meeting him and learning what he
wanted, said, "If you would be cured, take a piece of bread, and
dip it in the blood from your wound, and go and give it to the
Dog that bit you."  The Man who had been bitten laughed at this
advice and said, "Why? If I should do so, it would be as if I
should beg every Dog in the town to bite me."  
 
Benefits bestowed upon the evil-disposed increase their means of
injuring you.  
 

The Two Pots 
 
A RIVER carried down in its stream two Pots, one made of
earthenware and the other of brass.  The Earthen Pot said to the
Brass Pot, "Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me, for
if you touch me ever so slightly, I shall be broken in pieces,
and besides, I by no means wish to come near you."  
 
Equals make the best friends.  
 

The Wolf and the Sheep 
 
A WOLF, sorely wounded and bitten by dogs, lay sick and maimed in
his lair.  Being in want of food, he called to a Sheep who was
passing, and asked him to fetch some water from a stream flowing
close beside him.  "For," he said, "if you will bring me drink, I
will find means to provide myself with meat."  "Yes," said the
Sheep, "if I should bring you the draught, you would doubtless
make me provide the meat also."  
 
Hypocritical speeches are easily seen through.  
 

The Aethiop 
 
THE PURCHASER of a black servant was persuaded that the color of
his skin arose from dirt contracted through the neglect of his
former masters.  On bringing him home he resorted to every means
of cleaning, and subjected the man to incessant scrubbings.  The
servant caught a severe cold, but he never changed his color or
complexion.  
 
What's bred in the bone will stick to the flesh.  
 

The Fisherman and His Nets 
 
A FISHERMAN, engaged in his calling, made a very successful cast
and captured a great haul of fish.  He managed by a skillful
handling of his net to retain all the large fish and to draw them
to the shore; but he could not prevent the smaller fish from
falling back through the meshes of the net into the sea.  
 

The Huntsman and the Fisherman 
 
A HUNTSMAN, returning with his dogs from the field, fell in by
chance with a Fisherman who was bringing home a basket well laden
with fish.  The Huntsman wished to have the fish, and their owner
experienced an equal longing for the contents of the game-bag. 
They quickly agreed to exchange the produce of their day's sport. 
Each was so well pleased with his bargain that they made for some
time the same exchange day after day.  Finally a neighbor said to
them, "If you go on in this way, you will soon destroy by
frequent use the pleasure of your exchange, and each will again
wish to retain the fruits of his own sport."  
 
Abstain and enjoy.  
 

The Old Woman and the Wine-Jar 
 
AN OLD WOMAN found an empty jar which had lately been full of
prime old wine and which still retained the fragrant smell of its
former contents.  She greedily placed it several times to her
nose, and drawing it backwards and forwards said, "O most
delicious! How nice must the Wine itself have been, when it
leaves behind in the very vessel which contained it so sweet a
perfume!"  
 
The memory of a good deed lives.  
 

The Fox and the Crow 
 
A CROW having stolen a bit of meat, perched in a tree and held it
in her beak.  A Fox, seeing this, longed to possess the meat
himself, and by a wily stratagem succeeded.  "How handsome is the
Crow," he exclaimed, in the beauty of her shape and in the
fairness of her complexion! Oh, if her voice were only equal to
her beauty, she would deservedly be considered the Queen of
Birds!"  This he said deceitfully; but the Crow, anxious to refute
the reflection cast upon her voice, set up a loud caw and dropped
the flesh.  The Fox quickly picked it up, and thus addressed the
Crow:  "My good Crow, your voice is right enough, but your wit is
wanting."  
 

The Two Dogs 
 
A MAN had two dogs:  a Hound, trained to assist him in his sports,
and a Housedog, taught to watch the house.  When he returned home
after a good day's sport, he always gave the Housedog a large
share of his spoil.  The Hound, feeling much aggrieved at this,
reproached his companion, saying, "It is very hard to have all
this labor, while you, who do not assist in the chase, luxuriate
on the fruits of my exertions."  The Housedog replied, "Do not
blame me, my friend, but find fault with the master, who has not
taught me to labor, but to depend for subsistence on the labor of
others."  
 
Children are not to be blamed for the faults of their parents.  
 

The Stag in the Ox-Stall 
 
A STAG, roundly chased by the hounds and blinded by fear to the
danger he was running into, took shelter in a farmyard and hid
himself in a shed among the oxen.  An Ox gave him this kindly
warning:  "O unhappy creature! why should you thus, of your own
accord, incur destruction and trust yourself in the house of your
enemy?'  The Stag replied:  "Only allow me, friend, to stay where I
am, and I will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of
effecting my escape."  At the approach of the evening the herdsman
came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag; and even the
farm-bailiff with several laborers passed through the shed and
failed to notice him.  The Stag, congratulating himself on his
safety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had
kindly helped him in the hour of need.  One of them again
answered him:  "We indeed wish you well, but the danger is not
over.  There is one other yet to pass through the shed, who has
as it were a hundred eyes, and until he has come and gone, your
life is still in peril."  At that moment the master himself
entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had not been
properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out:  "Why is
there such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough straw
for them to lie on.  Those lazy fellows have not even swept the
cobwebs away."  While he thus examined everything in turn, he
spied the tips of the antlers of the Stag peeping out of the
straw.  Then summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag
should be seized and killed.  
 

The Hawk, the Kite, and the Pigeons 
 
THE PIGEONS, terrified by the appearance of a Kite, called upon
the Hawk to defend them.  He at once consented.  When they had
admitted him into the cote, they found that he made more havoc
and slew a larger number of them in one day than the Kite could
pounce upon in a whole year.  
 
Avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease.  
 

The Widow and the Sheep 
 
A CERTAIN poor widow had one solitary Sheep.  At shearing time,
wishing to take his fleece and to avoid expense, she sheared him
herself, but used the shears so unskillfully that with the fleece
she sheared the flesh.  The Sheep, writhing with pain, said, "Why
do you hurt me so, Mistress? What weight can my blood add to the
wool? If you want my flesh, there is the butcher, who will kill
me in an instant; but if you want my fleece and wool, there is
the shearer, who will shear and not hurt me."  
 
The least outlay is not always the greatest gain.  
 

The Wild Ass and the Lion 
 
A WILD ASS and a Lion entered into an alliance so that they might
capture the beasts of the forest with greater ease.  The Lion
agreed to assist the Wild Ass with his strength, while the Wild
Ass gave the Lion the benefit of his greater speed.  When they
had taken as many beasts as their necessities required, the Lion
undertook to distribute the prey, and for this purpose divided it
into three shares.  "I will take the first share," he said,
"because I am King:  and the second share, as a partner with you
in the chase:  and the third share (believe me) will be a source
of great evil to you, unless you willingly resign it to me, and
set off as fast as you can."  
 
Might makes right.  
 

The Eagle and the Arrow 
 
AN EAGLE sat on a lofty rock, watching the movements of a Hare
whom he sought to make his prey.  An archer, who saw the Eagle
from a place of concealment, took an accurate aim and wounded him
mortally.  The Eagle gave one look at the arrow that had entered
his heart and saw in that single glance that its feathers had
been furnished by himself.  "It is a double grief to me," he
exclaimed, "that I should perish by an arrow feathered from my
own wings."  
 

The Sick Kite 
 
A KITE, sick unto death, said to his mother:  "O Mother! do not
mourn, but at once invoke the gods that my life may be
prolonged."  She replied, "Alas! my son, which of the gods do you
think will pity you? Is there one whom you have not outraged by
filching from their very altars a part of the sacrifice offered
up to them?'  
 
We must make friends in prosperity if we would have their help in
adversity.  
 

The Lion and the Dolphin 
 
A LION roaming by the seashore saw a Dolphin lift up its head out
of the waves, and suggested that they contract an alliance,
saying that of all the animals they ought to be the best friends,
since the one was the king of beasts on the earth, and the other
was the sovereign ruler of all the inhabitants of the ocean.  The
Dolphin gladly consented to this request.  Not long afterwards
the Lion had a combat with a wild bull, and called on the Dolphin
to help him.  The Dolphin, though quite willing to give him
assistance, was unable to do so, as he could not by any means
reach the land.  The Lion abused him as a traitor.  The Dolphin
replied, "Nay, my friend, blame not me, but Nature, which, while
giving me the sovereignty of the sea, has quite denied me the
power of living upon the land."  
 

The Lion and the Boar 
 
ON A SUMMER DAY, when the great heat induced a general thirst
among the beasts, a Lion and a Boar came at the same moment to a
small well to drink.  They fiercely disputed which of them should
drink first, and were soon engaged in the agonies of a mortal
combat.  When they stopped suddenly to catch their breath for a
fiercer renewal of the fight, they saw some Vultures waiting in
the distance to feast on the one that should fall first.  They at
once made up their quarrel, saying, "It is better for us to make
friends, than to become the food of Crows or Vultures."  
 

The One-Eyed Doe 
 
A DOE blind in one eye was accustomed to graze as near to the
edge of the cliff as she possibly could, in the hope of securing
her greater safety.  She turned her sound eye towards the land
that she might get the earliest tidings of the approach of hunter
or hound, and her injured eye towards the sea, from whence she
entertained no anticipation of danger.  Some boatmen sailing by
saw her, and taking a successful aim, mortally wounded her. 
Yielding up her last breath, she gasped forth this lament:  "O
wretched creature that I am! to take such precaution against the
land, and after all to find this seashore, to which I had come
for safety, so much more perilous."  
 

The Shepherd and the Sea 
 
A SHEPHERD, keeping watch over his sheep near the shore, saw the
Sea very calm and smooth, and longed to make a voyage with a view
to commerce.  He sold all his flock, invested it in a cargo of
dates, and set sail.  But a very great tempest came on, and the
ship being in danger of sinking, he threw all his merchandise
overboard, and barely escaped with his life in the empty ship. 
Not long afterwards when someone passed by and observed the
unruffled calm of the Sea, he interrupted him and said, "It is
again in want of dates, and therefore looks quiet."  
 

The Ass, the Cock, and the Lion 
 
AN ASS and a Cock were in a straw-yard together when a Lion,
desperate from hunger, approached the spot.  He was about to
spring upon the Ass, when the Cock (to the sound of whose voice
the Lion, it is said, has a singular aversion) crowed loudly, and
the Lion fled away as fast as he could.  The Ass, observing his
trepidation at the mere crowing of a Cock summoned courage to
attack him, and galloped after him for that purpose.  He had run
no long distance, when the Lion, turning about, seized him and
tore him to pieces.  
 
False confidence often leads into danger.  
 

The Mice and the Weasels 
 
THE WEASELS and the Mice waged a perpetual war with each other,
in which much blood was shed.  The Weasels were always the
victors.  The Mice thought that the cause of their frequent
defeats was that they had no leaders set apart from the general
army to command them, and that they were exposed to dangers from
lack of discipline.  They therefore chose as leaders Mice that
were most renowned for their family descent, strength, and
counsel, as well as those most noted for their courage in the
fight, so that they might be better marshaled in battle array and
formed into troops, regiments, and battalions.  When all this was
done, and the army disciplined, and the herald Mouse had duly
proclaimed war by challenging the Weasels, the newly chosen
generals bound their heads with straws, that they might be more
conspicuous to all their troops.  Scarcely had the battle begun,
when a great rout overwhelmed the Mice, who scampered off as fast
as they could to their holes.  The generals, not being able to
get in on account of the ornaments on their heads, were all
captured and eaten by the Weasels.  
 
The more honor the more danger.  
 

The Mice in Council 
 
THE MICE summoned a council to decide how they might best devise
means of warning themselves of the approach of their great enemy
the Cat.  Among the many plans suggested, the one that found most
favor was the proposal to tie a bell to the neck of the Cat, so
that the Mice, being warned by the sound of the tinkling, might
run away and hide themselves in their holes at his approach.  But
when the Mice further debated who among them should thus "bell
the Cat," there was no one found to do it.  
 

The Wolf and the Housedog 
 
A WOLF, meeting a big well-fed Mastiff with a wooden collar about
his neck asked him who it was that fed him so well and yet
compelled him to drag that heavy log about wherever he went. 
"The master," he replied.  Then said the Wolf:  "May no friend of
mine ever be in such a plight; for the weight of this chain is
enough to spoil the appetite."  
 

The Rivers and the Sea 
 
THE RIVERS joined together to complain to the Sea, saying, "Why
is it that when we flow into your tides so potable and sweet, you
work in us such a change, and make us salty and unfit to drink?"
The Sea, perceiving that they intended to throw the blame on him,
said, "Pray cease to flow into me, and then you will not be made
briny."  
 

The Playful Ass 
 
AN ASS climbed up to the roof of a building, and frisking about
there, broke in the tiling.  The owner went up after him and
quickly drove him down, beating him severely with a thick wooden
cudgel.  The Ass said, "Why, I saw the Monkey do this very thing
yesterday, and you all laughed heartily, as if it afforded you
very great amusement."  
 

The Three Tradesmen 
 
A GREAT CITY was besieged, and its inhabitants were called
together to consider the best means of protecting it from the
enemy.  A Bricklayer earnestly recommended bricks as affording
the best material for an effective resistance.  A Carpenter, with
equal enthusiasm, proposed timber as a preferable method of
defense.  Upon which a Currier stood up and said, "Sirs, I differ
from you altogether:  there is no material for resistance equal to
a covering of hides; and nothing so good as leather."  
 
Every man for himself.  
 

The Master and His Dogs 
 
A CERTAIN MAN, detained by a storm in his country house, first of
all killed his sheep, and then his goats, for the maintenance of
his household.  The storm still continuing, he was obliged to
slaughter his yoke oxen for food.  On seeing this, his Dogs took
counsel together, and said, "It is time for us to be off, for if
the master spare not his oxen, who work for his gain, how can we
expect him to spare us?'  
 
He is not to be trusted as a friend who mistreats his own family. 

 
The Wolf and the Shepherds 
 
A WOLF, passing by, saw some Shepherds in a hut eating a haunch
of mutton for their dinner.  Approaching them, he said, "What a
clamor you would raise if I were to do as you are doing!"  
 

The Dolphins, the Whales, and the Sprat 
 
THE DOLPHINS and Whales waged a fierce war with each other.  When
the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the
waves and said that he would reconcile their differences if they
would accept him as an umpire.  One of the Dolphins replied, "We
would far rather be destroyed in our battle with each other than
admit any interference from you in our affairs."  
 

The Ass Carrying the Image 
 
AN ASS once carried through the streets of a city a famous wooden
Image, to be placed in one of its Temples.  As he passed along,
the crowd made lowly prostration before the Image.  The Ass,
thinking that they bowed their heads in token of respect for
himself, bristled up with pride, gave himself airs, and refused
to move another step.  The driver, seeing him thus stop, laid his
whip lustily about his shoulders and said, "O you perverse
dull-head! it is not yet come to this, that men pay worship to an
Ass."  
 
They are not wise who give to themselves the credit due to
others.  
 

The Two Travelers and the Axe 
 
TWO MEN were journeying together.  One of them picked up an axe
that lay upon the path, and said, "I have found an axe."  "Nay, my
friend," replied the other, "do not say 'I,' but 'We' have found
an axe."  They had not gone far before they saw the owner of the
axe pursuing them, and he who had picked up the axe said, "We are
undone."  "Nay," replied the other, "keep to your first mode of
speech, my friend; what you thought right then, think right now. 
Say 'I,' not 'We' are undone."  
 
He who shares the danger ought to share the prize.  
 

The Old Lion 
 
A LION, worn out with years and powerless from disease, lay on
the ground at the point of death.  A Boar rushed upon him, and
avenged with a stroke of his tusks a long-remembered injury. 
Shortly afterwards the Bull with his horns gored him as if he
were an enemy.  When the Ass saw that the huge beast could be
assailed with impunity, he let drive at his forehead with his
heels.  The expiring Lion said, "I have reluctantly brooked the
insults of the brave, but to be compelled to endure such
treatment from thee, a disgrace to Nature, is indeed to die a
double death."  
 

The Old Hound 
 
A HOUND, who in the days of his youth and strength had never
yielded to any beast of the forest, encountered in his old age a
boar in the chase.  He seized him boldly by the ear, but could
not retain his hold because of the decay of his teeth, so that
the boar escaped.  His master, quickly coming up, was very much
disappointed, and fiercely abused the dog.  The Hound looked up
and said, "It was not my fault.  master:  my spirit was as good as
ever, but I could not help my infirmities.  I rather deserve to
be praised for what I have been, than to be blamed for what I
am."  
 

The Bee and Jupiter 
 
A BEE from Mount Hymettus, the queen of the hive, ascended to
Olympus to present Jupiter some honey fresh from her combs. 
Jupiter, delighted with the offering of honey, promised to give
whatever she should ask.  She therefore besought him, saying,
"Give me, I pray thee, a sting, that if any mortal shall approach
to take my honey, I may kill him."  Jupiter was much displeased,
for he loved the race of man, but could not refuse the request
because of his promise.  He thus answered the Bee:  "You shall
have your request, but it will be at the peril of your own life. 
For if you use your sting, it shall remain in the wound you make,
and then you will die from the loss of it."  
 
Evil wishes, like chickens, come home to roost.  
 

The Milk-Woman and Her Pail 
 
A FARMER'S daughter was carrying her Pail of milk from the field
to the farmhouse, when she fell a-musing.  "The money for which
this milk will be sold, will buy at least three hundred eggs. 
The eggs, allowing for all mishaps, will produce two hundred and
fifty chickens.  The chickens will become ready for the market
when poultry will fetch the highest price, so that by the end of
the year I shall have money enough from my share to buy a new
gown.  In this dress I will go to the Christmas parties, where
all the young fellows will propose to me, but I will toss my head
and refuse them every one."  At this moment she tossed her head in
unison with her thoughts, when down fell the milk pail to the
ground, and all her imaginary schemes perished in a moment.  
 

The Seaside Travelers 
 
SOME TRAVELERS, journeying along the seashore, climbed to the
summit of a tall cliff, and looking over the sea, saw in the
distance what they thought was a large ship.  They waited in the
hope of seeing it enter the harbor, but as the object on which
they looked was driven nearer to shore by the wind, they found
that it could at the most be a small boat, and not a ship.  When
however it reached the beach, they discovered that it was only a
large faggot of sticks, and one of them said to his companions,
"We have waited for no purpose, for after all there is nothing to
see but a load of wood."  
 
Our mere anticipations of life outrun its realities.  
 

The Brazier and His Dog 
 
A BRAZIER had a little Dog, which was a great favorite with his
master, and his constant companion.  While he hammered away at
his metals the Dog slept; but when, on the other hand, he went to
dinner and began to eat, the Dog woke up and wagged his tail, as
if he would ask for a share of his meal.  His master one day,
pretending to be angry and shaking his stick at him, said, "You
wretched little sluggard! what shall I do to you? While I am
hammering on the anvil, you sleep on the mat; and when I begin to
eat after my toil, you wake up and wag your tail for food.  Do
you not know that labor is the source of every blessing, and that
none but those who work are entitled to eat?'  
 

The Ass and His Shadow 
 
A TRAVELER hired an Ass to convey him to a distant place.  The
day being intensely hot, and the sun shining in its strength, the
Traveler stopped to rest, and sought shelter from the heat under
the Shadow of the Ass.  As this afforded only protection for one,
and as the Traveler and the owner of the Ass both claimed it, a
violent dispute arose between them as to which of them had the
right to the Shadow.  The owner maintained that he had let the
Ass only, and not his Shadow.  The Traveler asserted that he had,
with the hire of the Ass, hired his Shadow also.  The quarrel
proceeded from words to blows, and while the men fought, the Ass
galloped off.  
 
In quarreling about the shadow we often lose the substance.  
 

The Ass and His Masters 
 
AN ASS, belonging to an herb-seller who gave him too little food
and too much work made a petition to Jupiter to be released from
his present service and provided with another master.  Jupiter,
after warning him that he would repent his request, caused him to
be sold to a tile-maker.  Shortly afterwards, finding that he had
heavier loads to carry and harder work in the brick-field, he
petitioned for another change of master.  Jupiter, telling him
that it would be the last time that he could grant his request,
ordained that he be sold to a tanner.  The Ass found that he had
fallen into worse hands, and noting his master's occupation,
said, groaning:  "It would have been better for me to have been
either starved by the one, or to have been overworked by the
other of my former masters, than to have been bought by my
present owner, who will even after I am dead tan my hide, and
make me useful to him."  
 

The Oak and the Reeds 
 
A VERY LARGE OAK was uprooted by the wind and thrown across a
stream.  It fell among some Reeds, which it thus addressed:  "I
wonder how you, who are so light and weak, are not entirely
crushed by these strong winds."  They replied, "You fight and
contend with the wind, and consequently you are destroyed; while
we on the contrary bend before the least breath of air, and
therefore remain unbroken, and escape."  
 
Stoop to conquer.  
 

The Fisherman and the Little Fish 
 
A FISHERMAN who lived on the produce of his nets, one day caught
a single small Fish as the result of his day's labor.  The Fish,
panting convulsively, thus entreated for his life:  "O Sir, what
good can I be to you, and how little am I worth? I am not yet
come to my full size.  Pray spare my life, and put me back into
the sea.  I shall soon become a large fish fit for the tables of
the rich, and then you can catch me again, and make a handsome
profit of me."  The Fisherman replied, "I should indeed be a very
simple fellow if, for the chance of a greater uncertain profit, I
were to forego my present certain gain."  
 

The Hunter and the Woodman 
 
A HUNTER, not very bold, was searching for the tracks of a Lion. 
He asked a man felling oaks in the forest if he had seen any
marks of his footsteps or knew where his lair was.  "I will,"
said the man, "at once show you the Lion himself."  The Hunter,
turning very pale and chattering with his teeth from fear,
replied, "No, thank you.  I did not ask that; it is his track
only I am in search of, not the Lion himself."  
 
The hero is brave in deeds as well as words.  
 

The Wild Boar and the Fox 
 
A WILD BOAR stood under a tree and rubbed his tusks against the
trunk.  A Fox passing by asked him why he thus sharpened his
teeth when there was no danger threatening from either huntsman
or hound.  He replied, "I do it advisedly; for it would never do
to have to sharpen my weapons just at the time I ought to be
using them."  
 

The Lion in a Farmyard 
 
A LION entered a farmyard.  The Farmer, wishing to catch him,
shut the gate.  When the Lion found that he could not escape, he
flew upon the sheep and killed them, and then attacked the oxen. 
The Farmer, beginning to be alarmed for his own safety, opened
the gate and released the Lion.  On his departure the Farmer
grievously lamented the destruction of his sheep and oxen, but
his wife, who had been a spectator to all that took place, said,
"On my word, you are rightly served, for how could you for a
moment think of shutting up a Lion along with you in your
farmyard when you know that you shake in your shoes if you only
hear his roar at a distance?'  
 

Mercury and the Sculptor 
 
MERCURY ONCE DETERMINED to learn in what esteem he was held among
mortals.  For this purpose he assumed the character of a man and
visited in this disguise a Sculptor's studio having looked at
various statues, he demanded the price of two figures of Jupiter
and Juno.  When the sum at which they were valued was named, he
pointed to a figure of himself, saying to the Sculptor, "You will
certainly want much more for this, as it is the statue of the
Messenger of the Gods, and author of all your gain."  The
Sculptor replied, "Well, if you will buy these, I'll fling you
that into the bargain."  
 

The Swan and the Goose 
 
A CERTAIN rich man bought in the market a Goose and a Swan.  He
fed the one for his table and kept the other for the sake of its
song.  When the time came for killing the Goose, the cook went to
get him at night, when it was dark, and he was not able to
distinguish one bird from the other.  By mistake he caught the
Swan instead of the Goose.  The Swan, threatened with death,
burst forth into song and thus made himself known by his voice,
and preserved his life by his melody.  
 

The Swollen Fox 
 
A VERY HUNGRY FOX, seeing some bread and meat left by shepherds
in the hollow of an oak, crept into the hole and made a hearty
meal.  When he finished, he was so full that he was not able to
get out, and began to groan and lament his fate.  Another Fox
passing by heard his cries, and coming up, inquired the cause of
his complaining.  On learning what had happened, he said to him,
"Ah, you will have to remain there, my friend, until you become
such as you were when you crept in, and then you will easily get
out."  
 

The Fox and the Woodcutter 
 
A FOX, running before the hounds, came across a Woodcutter
felling an oak and begged him to show him a safe hiding-place. 
The Woodcutter advised him to take shelter in his own hut, so the
Fox crept in and hid himself in a corner.  The huntsman soon came
up with his hounds and inquired of the Woodcutter if he had seen
the Fox.  He declared that he had not seen him, and yet pointed,
all the time he was speaking, to the hut where the Fox lay
hidden.  The huntsman took no notice of the signs, but believing
his word, hastened forward in the chase.  As soon as they were
well away, the Fox departed without taking any notice of the
Woodcutter:  whereon he called to him and reproached him, saying,
"You ungrateful fellow, you owe your life to me, and yet you
leave me without a word of thanks."  The Fox replied, "Indeed, I
should have thanked you fervently if your deeds had been as good
as your words, and if your hands had not been traitors to your
speech."  
 

The Birdcatcher, the Partridge, and the Cock 
 
A BIRDCATCHER was about to sit down to a dinner of herbs when a
friend unexpectedly came in.  The bird-trap was quite empty, as
he had caught nothing, and he had to kill a pied Partridge, which
he had tamed for a decoy.  The bird entreated earnestly for his
life:  "What would you do without me when next you spread your
nets? Who would chirp you to sleep, or call for you the covey of
answering birds?'  The Birdcatcher spared his life, and determined
to pick out a fine young Cock just attaining to his comb.  But
the Cock expostulated in piteous tones from his perch:  "If you
kill me, who will announce to you the appearance of the dawn? 
Who will wake you to your daily tasks or tell you when it is time
to visit the bird-trap in the morning?'  He replied, "What you say
is true.  You are a capital bird at telling the time of day.  But
my friend and I must have our dinners."  
 
Necessity knows no law.  
 

The Monkey and the Fishermen 
 
A MONKEY perched upon a lofty tree saw some Fishermen casting
their nets into a river, and narrowly watched their proceedings. 
The Fishermen after a while gave up fishing, and on going home to
dinner left their nets upon the bank.  The Monkey, who is the
most imitative of animals, descended from the treetop and
endeavored to do as they had done.  Having handled the net, he
threw it into the river, but became tangled in the meshes and
drowned.  With his last breath he said to himself, "I am rightly
served; for what business had I who had never handled a net to
try and catch fish?'  
 

The Flea and the Wrestler 
 
A FLEA settled upon the bare foot of a Wrestler and bit him,
causing the man to call loudly upon Hercules for help.  When the
Flea a second time hopped upon his foot, he groaned and said, "O
Hercules! if you will not help me against a Flea, how can I hope
for your assistance against greater antagonists?'  
 

The Two Frogs 
 
TWO FROGS dwelt in the same pool.  When the pool dried up under
the summer's heat, they left it and set out together for another
home.  As they went along they chanced to pass a deep well, amply
supplied with water, and when they saw it, one of the Frogs said
to the other, "Let us descend and make our abode in this well:  it
will furnish us with shelter and food."  The other replied with
greater caution, "But suppose the water should fail us.  How can
we get out again from so great a depth?'  
 
Do nothing without a regard to the consequences.  
 

The Cat and the Mice 
 
A CERTAIN HOUSE was overrun with Mice.  A Cat, discovering this,
made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. 
Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their
holes.  The Cat was no longer able to get at them and perceived
that she must tempt them forth by some device.  For this purpose
she jumped upon a peg, and suspending herself from it, pretended
to be dead.  One of the Mice, peeping stealthily out, saw her and
said, "Ah, my good madam, even though you should turn into a
meal-bag, we will not come near you."  
 

The Lion, the Bear, and the Fox 
 
A LION and a Bear seized a Kid at the same moment, and fought
fiercely for its possession.  When they had fearfully lacerated
each other and were faint from the long combat, they lay down
exhausted with fatigue.  A Fox, who had gone round them at a
distance several times, saw them both stretched on the ground
with the Kid lying untouched in the middle.  He ran in between
them, and seizing the Kid scampered off as fast as he could.  The
Lion and the Bear saw him, but not being able to get up, said,
"Woe be to us, that we should have fought and belabored ourselves
only to serve the turn of a Fox."  
 
It sometimes happens that one man has all the toil, and another
all the profit.  
 

The Doe and the Lion 
 
A DOE hard pressed by hunters sought refuge in a cave belonging
to a Lion.  The Lion concealed himself on seeing her approach,
but when she was safe within the cave, sprang upon her and tore
her to pieces.  "Woe is me," exclaimed the Doe, "who have escaped
from man, only to throw myself into the mouth of a wild beast?'  
 
In avoiding one evil, care must be taken not to fall into
another.  
 

The Farmer and the Fox 
 
A FARMER, who bore a grudge against a Fox for robbing his poultry
yard, caught him at last, and being determined to take an ample
revenge, tied some rope well soaked in oil to his tail, and set
it on fire.  The Fox by a strange fatality rushed to the fields
of the Farmer who had captured him.  It was the time of the wheat
harvest; but the Farmer reaped nothing that year and returned
home grieving sorely.  
 

The Seagull and the Kite 
 
A SEAGULL having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep
gullet-bag and lay down on the shore to die.  A Kite saw him and
exclaimed:  "You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air
has no business to seek its food from the sea."  
 
Every man should be content to mind his own business.  
 

The Philosopher, the Ants, and Mercury 
 
A PHILOSOPHER witnessed from the shore the shipwreck of a vessel,
of which the crew and passengers were all drowned.  He inveighed
against the injustice of Providence, which would for the sake of
one criminal perchance sailing in the ship allow so many innocent
persons to perish.  As he was indulging in these reflections, he
found himself surrounded by a whole army of Ants, near whose nest
he was standing.  One of them climbed up and stung him, and he
immediately trampled them all to death with his foot.  Mercury
presented himself, and striking the Philosopher with his wand,
said, "And are you indeed to make yourself a judge of the
dealings of Providence, who hast thyself in a similar manner
treated these poor Ants?'  
 

The Mouse and the Bull 
 
A BULL was bitten by a Mouse and, angered by the wound, tried to
capture him.  But the Mouse reached his hole in safety.  Though
the Bull dug into the walls with his horns, he tired before he
could rout out the Mouse, and crouching down, went to sleep
outside the hole.  The Mouse peeped out, crept furtively up his
flank, and again biting him, retreated to his hole.  The Bull
rising up, and not knowing what to do, was sadly perplexed.  At
which the Mouse said, "The great do not always prevail.  There
are times when the small and lowly are the strongest to do
mischief."  
 

The Lion and the Hare 
 
A LION came across a Hare, who was fast asleep.  He was just in
the act of seizing her, when a fine young Hart trotted by, and he
left the Hare to follow him.  The Hare, scared by the noise,
awoke and scudded away.  The Lion was unable after a long chase
to catch the Hart, and returned to feed upon the Hare.  On
finding that the Hare also had run off, he said, "I am rightly
served, for having let go of the food that I had in my hand for
the chance of obtaining more."  
 

The Peasant and the Eagle 
 
A PEASANT found an Eagle captured in a trap, and much admiring
the bird, set him free.  The Eagle did not prove ungrateful to
his deliverer, for seeing the Peasant sitting under a wall which
was not safe, he flew toward him and with his talons snatched a
bundle from his head.  When the Peasant rose in pursuit, the
Eagle let the bundle fall again.  Taking it up, the man returned
to the same place, to find that the wall under which he had been
sitting had fallen to pieces; and he marveled at the service
rendered him by the Eagle.  
 

The Image of Mercury and the Carpenter 
 
A VERY POOR MAN, a Carpenter by trade, had a wooden image of
Mercury, before which he made offerings day by day, and begged
the idol to make him rich, but in spite of his entreaties he
became poorer and poorer.  At last, being very angry, he took his
image down from its pedestal and dashed it against the wall. 
When its head was knocked off, out came a stream of gold, which
the Carpenter quickly picked up and said, "Well, I think thou art
altogether contradictory and unreasonable; for when I paid you
honor, I reaped no benefits:  but now that I maltreat you I am
loaded with an abundance of riches."  
 

The Bull and the Goat 
 
A BULL, escaping from a Lion, hid in a cave which some shepherds
had recently occupied.  As soon as he entered, a He-Goat left in
the cave sharply attacked him with his horns.  The Bull quietly
addressed him:  "Butt away as much as you will.  I have no fear of
you, but of the Lion.  Let that monster go away and I will soon
let you know what is the respective strength of a Goat and a
Bull."  
 
It shows an evil disposition to take advantage of a friend in
distress.  
 

The Dancing Monkeys 
 
A PRINCE had some Monkeys trained to dance.  Being naturally
great mimics of men's actions, they showed themselves most apt
pupils, and when arrayed in their rich clothes and masks, they
danced as well as any of the courtiers.  The spectacle was often
repeated with great applause, till on one occasion a courtier,
bent on mischief, took from his pocket a handful of nuts and
threw them upon the stage.  The Monkeys at the sight of the nuts
forgot their dancing and became (as indeed they were) Monkeys
instead of actors.  Pulling off their masks and tearing their
robes, they fought with one another for the nuts.  The dancing
spectacle thus came to an end amidst the laughter and ridicule of
the audience.  
 
The Fox and the Leopard 
 
THE FOX and the Leopard disputed which was the more beautiful of
the two.  The Leopard exhibited one by one the various spots
which decorated his skin.  But the Fox, interrupting him, said,
"And how much more beautiful than you am I, who am decorated, not
in body, but in mind."  
 

The Monkeys and Their Mother 
 
THE MONKEY, it is said, has two young ones at each birth.  The
Mother fondles one and nurtures it with the greatest affection
and care, but hates and neglects the other.  It happened once
that the young one which was caressed and loved was smothered by
the too great affection of the Mother, while the despised one was
nurtured and reared in spite of the neglect to which it was
exposed.  
 
The best intentions will not always ensure success.  
 

The Oaks and Jupiter 
 
THE OAKS presented a complaint to Jupiter, saying, "We bear for
no purpose the burden of life, as of all the trees that grow we
are the most continually in peril of the axe."  Jupiter made
answer:  "You have only to thank yourselves for the misfortunes to
which you are exposed:  for if you did not make such excellent
pillars and posts, and prove yourselves so serviceable to the
carpenters and the farmers, the axe would not so frequently be
laid to your roots."  
 

The Hare and the Hound 
 
A HOUND started a Hare from his lair, but after a long run, gave
up the chase.  A goat-herd seeing him stop, mocked him, saying
"The little one is the best runner of the two."  The Hound
replied, "You do not see the difference between us:  I was only
running for a dinner, but he for his life."  
 

The Traveler and Fortune 
 
A TRAVELER wearied from a long journey lay down, overcome with
fatigue, on the very brink of a deep well.  Just as he was about
to fall into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him
and waking him from his slumber thus addressed him:  "Good Sir,
pray wake up:  for if you fall into the well, the blame will be
thrown on me, and I shall get an ill name among mortals; for I
find that men are sure to impute their calamities to me, however
much by their own folly they have really brought them on
themselves."  
 
Everyone is more or less master of his own fate.  
 

The Bald Knight 
 
A BALD KNIGHT, who wore a wig, went out to hunt.  A sudden puff
of wind blew off his hat and wig, at which a loud laugh rang
forth from his companions.  He pulled up his horse, and with
great glee joined in the joke by saying, "What a marvel it is
that hairs which are not mine should fly from me, when they have
forsaken even the man on whose head they grew."  
 

The Shepherd and the Dog 
 
A SHEPHERD penning his sheep in the fold for the night was about
to shut up a wolf with them, when his Dog perceiving the wolf
said, "Master, how can you expect the sheep to be safe if you
admit a wolf into the fold?'  
 

The Lamp 
 
A LAMP, soaked with too much oil and flaring brightly, boasted
that it gave more light than the sun.  Then a sudden puff of wind
arose, and the Lamp was immediately extinguished.  Its owner lit
it again, and said:  "Boast no more, but henceforth be content to
give thy light in silence.  Know that not even the stars need to
be relit" 
 

The Lion, the Fox, and the Ass 
 
THE LION, the Fox and the Ass entered into an agreement to assist
each other in the chase.  Having secured a large booty, the Lion
on their return from the forest asked the Ass to allot his due
portion to each of the three partners in the treaty.  The Ass
carefully divided the spoil into three equal shares and modestly
requested the two others to make the first choice.  The Lion,
bursting out into a great rage, devoured the Ass.  Then he
requested the Fox to do him the favor to make a division.  The
Fox accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and
left to himself the smallest possible morsel.  The Lion said,
"Who has taught you, my very excellent fellow, the art of
division? You are perfect to a fraction."  He replied, "I learned
it from the Ass, by witnessing his fate."  
 
Happy is the man who learns from the misfortunes of others.  
 

The Bull, the Lioness, and the Wild-Boar Hunter 
 
A BULL finding a lion's cub asleep gored him to death with his
horns.  The Lioness came up, and bitterly lamented the death of
her whelp.  A wild-boar Hunter, seeing her distress, stood at a
distance and said to her, "Think how many men there are who have
reason to lament the loss of their children, whose deaths have
been caused by you."  
 

The Oak and the Woodcutters 
 
THE WOODCUTTER cut down a Mountain Oak and split it in pieces,
making wedges of its own branches for dividing the trunk.  The
Oak said with a sigh, "I do not care about the blows of the axe
aimed at my roots, but I do grieve at being torn in pieces by
these wedges made from my own branches."  
 
Misfortunes springing from ourselves are the hardest to bear.  
 

The Hen and the Golden Eggs 
 
A COTTAGER and his wife had a Hen that laid a golden egg every
day.  They supposed that the Hen must contain a great lump of
gold in its inside, and in order to get the gold they killed it. 
Having done so, they found to their surprise that the Hen
differed in no respect from their other hens.  The foolish pair,
thus hoping to become rich all at once, deprived themselves of
the gain of which they were assured day by day.  
 

The Ass and the Frogs 
 
AN ASS, carrying a load of wood, passed through a pond.  As he
was crossing through the water he lost his footing, stumbled and
fell, and not being able to rise on account of his load, groaned
heavily.  Some Frogs frequenting the pool heard his lamentation,
and said, "What would you do if you had to live here always as we
do, when you make such a fuss about a mere fall into the water?"

 
Men often bear little grievances with less courage than they do
large misfortunes.  
 

The Crow and the Raven 
 
A CROW was jealous of the Raven, because he was considered a bird
of good omen and always attracted the attention of men, who noted
by his flight the good or evil course of future events.  Seeing
some travelers approaching, the Crow flew up into a tree, and
perching herself on one of the branches, cawed as loudly as she
could.  The travelers turned towards the sound and wondered what
it foreboded, when one of them said to his companion, "Let us
proceed on our journey, my friend, for it is only the caw of a
crow, and her cry, you know, is no omen."  
 
Those who assume a character which does not belong to them, only
make themselves ridiculous.  
 

The Trees and the Axe 
 
A MAN came into a forest and asked the Trees to provide him a
handle for his axe.  The Trees consented to his request and gave
him a young ash-tree.  No sooner had the man fitted a new handle
to his axe from it, than he began to use it and quickly felled
with his strokes the noblest giants of the forest.  An old oak,
lamenting when too late the destruction of his companions, said
to a neighboring cedar, "The first step has lost us all.  If we
had not given up the rights of the ash, we might yet have
retained our own privileges and have stood for ages."  
 

The Crab and the Fox 
 
A CRAB, forsaking the seashore, chose a neighboring green meadow
as its feeding ground.  A Fox came across him, and being very
hungry ate him up.  Just as he was on the point of being eaten,
the Crab said, "I well deserve my fate, for what business had I
on the land, when by my nature and habits I am only adapted for
the sea?'  
 
Contentment with our lot is an element of happiness.  
 

The Woman and Her Hen 
 
A WOMAN possessed a Hen that gave her an egg every day.  She
often pondered how she might obtain two eggs daily instead of
one, and at last, to gain her purpose, determined to give the Hen
a double allowance of barley.  From that day the Hen became fat
and sleek, and never once laid another egg.  
 

The Ass and the Old Shepherd 
 
A SHEPHERD, watching his Ass feeding in a meadow, was alarmed all
of a sudden by the cries of the enemy.  He appealed to the Ass to
fly with him, lest they should both be captured, but the animal
lazily replied, "Why should I, pray? Do you think it likely the
conqueror will place on me two sets of panniers?'  "No," rejoined
the Shepherd.  "Then," said the Ass, "as long as I carry the
panniers, what matters it to me whom I serve?'  
 
In a change of government the poor change nothing beyond the name
of their master.  
 

The Kites and the Swans 
 
TEE KITES of olden times, as well as the Swans, had the privilege
of song.  But having heard the neigh of the horse, they were so
enchanted with the sound, that they tried to imitate it; and, in
trying to neigh, they forgot how to sing.  
 
The desire for imaginary benefits often involves the loss of
present blessings.  
 

The Wolves and the Sheepdogs 
 
THE WOLVES thus addressed the Sheepdogs:  "Why should you, who are
like us in so many things, not be entirely of one mind with us,
and live with us as brothers should? We differ from you in one
point only.  We live in freedom, but you bow down to and slave
for men, who in return for your services flog you with whips and
put collars on your necks.  They make you also guard their sheep,
and while they eat the mutton throw only the bones to you.  If
you will be persuaded by us, you will give us the sheep, and we
will enjoy them in common, till we all are surfeited."  The Dogs
listened favorably to these proposals, and, entering the den of
the Wolves, they were set upon and torn to pieces.  
 

The Hares and the Foxes 
 
THE HARES waged war with the Eagles, and called upon the Foxes to
help them.  They replied, "We would willingly have helped you, if
we had not known who you were, and with whom you were fighting."

Count the cost before you commit yourselves.  
 

The Bowman and Lion 
 
A VERY SKILLFUL BOWMAN went to the mountains in search of game,
but all the beasts of the forest fled at his approach.  The Lion
alone challenged him to combat.  The Bowman immediately shot out
an arrow and said to the Lion:  "I send thee my messenger, that
from him thou mayest learn what I myself shall be when I assail
thee."  The wounded Lion rushed away in great fear, and when a Fox
who had seen it all happen told him to be of good courage and not
to back off at the first attack he replied:  "You counsel me in
vain; for if he sends so fearful a messenger, how shall I abide
the attack of the man himself?'  
 
Be on guard against men who can strike from a distance.  
 

The Camel 
 
WHEN MAN first saw the Camel, he was so frightened at his vast
size that he ran away.  After a time, perceiving the meekness and
gentleness of the beast's temper, he summoned courage enough to
approach him.  Soon afterwards, observing that he was an animal
altogether deficient in spirit, he assumed such boldness as to
put a bridle in his mouth, and to let a child drive him.  
 
Use serves to overcome dread.  
 

The Wasp and the Snake 
 
A WASP seated himself upon the head of a Snake and, striking him
unceasingly with his stings, wounded him to death.  The Snake,
being in great torment and not knowing how to rid himself of his
enemy, saw a wagon heavily laden with wood, and went and
purposely placed his head under the wheels, saying, "At least my
enemy and I shall perish together."  
 

The Dog and the Hare 
 
A HOUND having started a Hare on the hillside pursued her for
some distance, at one time biting her with his teeth as if he
would take her life, and at another fawning upon her, as if in
play with another dog.  The Hare said to him, "I wish you would
act sincerely by me, and show yourself in your true colors.  If
you are a friend, why do you bite me so hard? If an enemy, why do
you fawn on me?'  
 
No one can be a friend if you know not whether to trust or
distrust him.  
 

The Bull and the Calf 
 
A BULL was striving with all his might to squeeze himself through
a narrow passage which led to his stall.  A young Calf came up,
and offered to go before and show him the way by which he could
manage to pass.  "Save yourself the trouble," said the Bull; "I
knew that way long before you were born."  
 

The Stag, the Wolf, and the Sheep 
 
A STAG asked a Sheep to lend him a measure of wheat, and said
that the Wolf would be his surety.  The Sheep, fearing some fraud
was intended, excused herself, saying, "The Wolf is accustomed to
seize what he wants and to run off; and you, too, can quickly
outstrip me in your rapid flight.  How then shall I be able to
find you, when the day of payment comes?'  
 
Two blacks do not make one white.  
 

The Peacock and the Crane 
 
A PEACOCK spreading its gorgeous tail mocked a Crane that passed
by, ridiculing the ashen hue of its plumage and saying, "I am
robed, like a king, in gold and purple and all the colors of the
rainbow; while you have not a bit of color on your wings."
"True," replied the Crane; "but I soar to the heights of heaven
and lift up my voice to the stars, while you walk below, like a
cock, among the birds of the dunghill."  
 
Fine feathers don't make fine birds.  
 

The Fox and the Hedgehog 
 
A FOX swimming across a rapid river was carried by the force of
the current into a very deep ravine, where he lay for a long time
very much bruised, sick, and unable to move.  A swarm of hungry
blood-sucking flies settled upon him.  A Hedgehog, passing by,
saw his anguish and inquired if he should drive away the flies
that were tormenting him.  "By no means," replied the Fox; "pray
do not molest them."  "How is this?'  said the Hedgehog; "do you
not want to be rid of them?'  "No," returned the Fox, "for these
flies which you see are full of blood, and sting me but little,
and if you rid me of these which are already satiated, others
more hungry will come in their place, and will drink up all the
blood I have left."  
 

The Eagle, the Cat, and the Wild Sow 
 
AN EAGLE made her nest at the top of a lofty oak; a Cat, having
found a convenient hole, moved into the middle of the trunk; and
a Wild Sow, with her young, took shelter in a hollow at its foot. 
The Cat cunningly resolved to destroy this chance-made colony. 
To carry out her design, she climbed to the nest of the Eagle,
and said, "Destruction is preparing for you, and for me too,
unfortunately.  The Wild Sow, whom you see daily digging up the
earth, wishes to uproot the oak, so she may on its fall seize our
families as food for her young."  Having thus frightened the Eagle
out of her senses, she crept down to the cave of the Sow, and
said, "Your children are in great danger; for as soon as you go
out with your litter to find food, the Eagle is prepared to
pounce upon one of your little pigs."  Having instilled these
fears into the Sow, she went and pretended to hide herself in the
hollow of the tree.  When night came she went forth with silent
foot and obtained food for herself and her kittens, but feigning
to be afraid, she kept a lookout all through the day.  Meanwhile,
the Eagle, full of fear of the Sow, sat still on the branches,
and the Sow, terrified by the Eagle, did not dare to go out from
her cave.  And thus they both, along with their families,
perished from hunger, and afforded ample provision for the Cat
and her kittens.  
 

The Thief and the Innkeeper 
 
A THIEF hired a room in a tavern and stayed a while in the hope
of stealing something which should enable him to pay his
reckoning.  When he had waited some days in vain, he saw the
Innkeeper dressed in a new and handsome coat and sitting before
his door.  The Thief sat down beside him and talked with him.  As
the conversation began to flag, the Thief yawned terribly and at
the same time howled like a wolf.  The Innkeeper said, "Why do
you howl so fearfully?'  "I will tell you," said the Thief, "but
first let me ask you to hold my clothes, or I shall tear them to
pieces.  I know not, sir, when I got this habit of yawning, nor
whether these attacks of howling were inflicted on me as a
judgment for my crimes, or for any other cause; but this I do
know, that when I yawn for the third time, I actually turn into a
wolf and attack men."  With this speech he commenced a second fit
of yawning and again howled like a wolf, as he had at first.  The
Innkeeper.  hearing his tale and believing what he said, became
greatly alarmed and, rising from his seat, attempted to run away. 
The Thief laid hold of his coat and entreated him to stop,
saying, "Pray wait, sir, and hold my clothes, or I shall tear
them to pieces in my fury, when I turn into a wolf."  At the same
moment he yawned the third time and set up a terrible howl.  The
Innkeeper, frightened lest he should be attacked, left his new
coat in the Thief's hand and ran as fast as he could into the inn
for safety.  The Thief made off with the coat and did not return
again to the inn.  
 
Every tale is not to be believed.  
 

The Mule 
 
A MULE, frolicsome from lack of work and from too much corn,
galloped about in a very extravagant manner, and said to himself:
"My father surely was a high-mettled racer, and I am his own
child in speed and spirit."  On the next day, being driven a long
journey, and feeling very wearied, he exclaimed in a disconsolate
tone:  "I must have made a mistake; my father, after all, could
have been only an ass."  
 

The Hart and the Vine 
 
A HART, hard pressed in the chase, hid himself beneath the large
leaves of a Vine.  The huntsmen, in their haste, overshot the
place of his concealment.  Supposing all danger to have passed,
the Hart began to nibble the tendrils of the Vine.  One of the
huntsmen, attracted by the rustling of the leaves, looked back,
and seeing the Hart, shot an arrow from his bow and struck it. 
The Hart, at the point of death, groaned:  "I am rightly served,
for I should not have maltreated the Vine that saved me."  
 

The Serpent and the Eagle 
 
A SERPENT and an Eagle were struggling with each other in deadly
conflict.  The Serpent had the advantage, and was about to
strangle the bird.  A countryman saw them, and running up, loosed
the coil of the Serpent and let the Eagle go free.  The Serpent,
irritated at the escape of his prey, injected his poison into the
drinking horn of the countryman.  The rustic, ignorant of his
danger, was about to drink, when the Eagle struck his hand with
his wing, and, seizing the drinking horn in his talons, carried
it aloft.  
 

The Crow and the Pitcher 
 
A CROW perishing with thirst saw a pitcher, and hoping to find
water, flew to it with delight.  When he reached it, he
discovered to his grief that it contained so little water that he
could not possibly get at it.  He tried everything he could think
of to reach the water, but all his efforts were in vain.  At last
he collected as many stones as he could carry and dropped them
one by one with his beak into the pitcher, until he brought the
water within his reach and thus saved his life.  
 
Necessity is the mother of invention.  
 

The Two Frogs 
 
TWO FROGS were neighbors.  One inhabited a deep pond, far removed
from public view; the other lived in a gully containing little
water, and traversed by a country road.  The Frog that lived in
the pond warned his friend to change his residence and entreated
him to come and live with him, saying that he would enjoy greater
safety from danger and more abundant food.  The other refused,
saying that he felt it so very hard to leave a place to which he
had become accustomed.  A few days afterwards a heavy wagon
passed through the gully and crushed him to death under its
wheels.  
 
A willful man will have his way to his own hurt.  
 

The Wolf and the Fox 
 
AT ONE TIME a very large and strong Wolf was born among the
wolves, who exceeded all his fellow-wolves in strength, size, and
swiftness, so that they unanimously decided to call him "Lion."
The Wolf, with a lack of sense proportioned to his enormous size,
thought that they gave him this name in earnest, and, leaving his
own race, consorted exclusively with the lions.  An old sly Fox,
seeing this, said, "May I never make myself so ridiculous as you
do in your pride and self-conceit; for even though you have the
size of a lion among wolves, in a herd of lions you are
definitely a wolf."  
 

The Walnut-Tree 
 
A WALNUT TREE standing by the roadside bore an abundant crop of
fruit.  For the sake of the nuts, the passers-by broke its
branches with stones and sticks.  The Walnut-Tree piteously
exclaimed, "O wretched me! that those whom I cheer with my fruit
should repay me with these painful requitals!"  
 

The Gnat and the Lion 
 
A GNAT came and said to a Lion, "I do not in the least fear you,
nor are you stronger than I am.  For in what does your strength
consist? You can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth
an a woman in her quarrels.  I repeat that I am altogether more
powerful than you; and if you doubt it, let us fight and see who
will conquer."  The Gnat, having sounded his horn, fastened
himself upon the Lion and stung him on the nostrils and the parts
of the face devoid of hair.  While trying to crush him, the Lion
tore himself with his claws, until he punished himself severely. 
The Gnat thus prevailed over the Lion, and, buzzing about in a
song of triumph, flew away.  But shortly afterwards he became
entangled in the meshes of a cobweb and was eaten by a spider. 
He greatly lamented his fate, saying, "Woe is me! that I, who can
wage war successfully with the hugest beasts, should perish
myself from this spider, the most inconsiderable of insects!"  
 

The Monkey and the Dolphin 
 
A SAILOR, bound on a long voyage, took with him a Monkey to amuse
him while on shipboard.  As he sailed off the coast of Greece, a
violent tempest arose in which the ship was wrecked and he, his
Monkey, and all the crew were obliged to swim for their lives.  A
Dolphin saw the Monkey contending with the waves, and supposing
him to be a man (whom he is always said to befriend), came and
placed himself under him, to convey him on his back in safety to
the shore.  When the Dolphin arrived with his burden in sight of
land not far from Athens, he asked the Monkey if he were an
Athenian.  The latter replied that he was, and that he was
descended from one of the most noble families in that city.  The
Dolphin then inquired if he knew the Piraeus (the famous harbor
of Athens).  Supposing that a man was meant, the Monkey answered
that he knew him very well and that he was an intimate friend. 
The Dolphin, indignant at these falsehoods, dipped the Monkey
under the water and drowned him.  
 

The Jackdaw and the Doves 
 
A JACKDAW, seeing some Doves in a cote abundantly provided with
food, painted himself white and joined them in order to share
their plentiful maintenance.  The Doves, as long as he was
silent, supposed him to be one of themselves and admitted him to
their cote.  But when one day he forgot himself and began to
chatter, they discovered his true character and drove him forth,
pecking him with their beaks.  Failing to obtain food among the
Doves, he returned to the Jackdaws.  They too, not recognizing
him on account of his color.  expelled him from living with them. 
So desiring two ends, he obtained neither.  
 

The Horse and the Stag 
 
AT ONE TIME the Horse had the plain entirely to himself.  Then a
Stag intruded into his domain and shared his pasture.  The Horse,
desiring to revenge himself on the stranger, asked a man if he
were willing to help him in punishing the Stag.  The man replied
that if the Horse would receive a bit in his mouth and agree to
carry him, he would contrive effective weapons against the Stag. 
The Horse consented and allowed the man to mount him.  From that
hour he found that instead of obtaining revenge on the Stag, he
had enslaved himself to the service of man.  
 

The Kid and the Wolf 
 
A KID, returning without protection from the pasture, was pursued
by a Wolf.  Seeing he could not escape, he turned round, and
said:  "I know, friend Wolf, that I must be your prey, but before
I die I would ask of you one favor you will play me a tune to
which I may dance."  The Wolf complied, and while he was piping
and the Kid was dancing, some hounds hearing the sound ran up and
began chasing the Wolf.  Turning to the Kid, he said, "It is just
what I deserve; for I, who am only a butcher, should not have
turned piper to please you."  
 

The Prophet 
 
A WIZARD, sitting in the marketplace, was telling the fortunes of
the passers-by when a person ran up in great haste, and
announced to him that the doors of his house had been broken open
and that all his goods were being stolen.  He sighed heavily and
hastened away as fast as he could run.  A neighbor saw him
running and said, "Oh! you fellow there! you say you can foretell
the fortunes of others; how is it you did not foresee your own?'  
 

The Fox and the Monkey 
 
A FOX and a Monkey were traveling together on the same road.  As
they journeyed, they passed through a cemetery full of monuments. 
"All these monuments which you see," said the Monkey, "are
erected in honor of my ancestors, who were in their day freedmen
and citizens of great renown."  The Fox replied, "You have chosen
a most appropriate subject for your falsehoods, as I am sure none
of your ancestors will be able to contradict you."  
 
A false tale often betrays itself.  
 

The Thief and the Housedog 
 
A THIEF came in the night to break into a house.  He brought with
him several slices of meat in order to pacify the Housedog, so
that he would not alarm his master by barking.  As the Thief
threw him the pieces of meat, the Dog said, "If you think to stop
my mouth, you will be greatly mistaken.  This sudden kindness at
your hands will only make me more watchful, lest under these
unexpected favors to myself, you have some private ends to
accomplish for your own benefit, and for my master's injury."  
 

The Man, the Horse, the Ox, and the Dog 
 
A HORSE, Ox, and Dog, driven to great straits by the cold, sought
shelter and protection from Man.  He received them kindly,
lighted a fire, and warmed them.  He let the Horse make free with
his oats, gave the Ox an abundance of hay, and fed the Dog with
meat from his own table.  Grateful for these favors, the animals
determined to repay him to the best of their ability.  For this
purpose, they divided the term of his life between them, and each
endowed one portion of it with the qualities which chiefly
characterized himself.  The Horse chose his earliest years and
gave them his own attributes:  hence every man is in his youth
impetuous, headstrong, and obstinate in maintaining his own
opinion.  The Ox took under his patronage the next term of life,
and therefore man in his middle age is fond of work, devoted to
labor, and resolute to amass wealth and to husband his resources. 
The end of life was reserved for the Dog, wherefore the old man
is often snappish, irritable, hard to please, and selfish,
tolerant only of his own household, but averse to strangers and
to all who do not administer to his comfort or to his
necessities.  
 

The Apes and the Two Travelers 
 
TWO MEN, one who always spoke the truth and the other who told
nothing but lies, were traveling together and by chance came to
the land of Apes.  One of the Apes, who had raised himself to be
king, commanded them to be seized and brought before him, that he
might know what was said of him among men.  He ordered at the
same time that all the Apes be arranged in a long row on his
right hand and on his left, and that a throne be placed for him,
as was the custom among men.  After these preparations he
signified that the two men should be brought before him, and
greeted them with this salutation:  "What sort of a king do I seem
to you to be, O strangers?'  The Lying Traveler replied, "You seem
to me a most mighty king."  "And what is your estimate of those
you see around me?'  "These," he made answer, "are worthy
companions of yourself, fit at least to be ambassadors and
leaders of armies."  The Ape and all his court, gratified with the
lie, commanded that a handsome present be given to the flatterer. 
On this the truthful Traveler thought to himself, "If so great a
reward be given for a lie, with what gift may not I be rewarded,
if, according to my custom, I tell the truth?'  The Ape quickly
turned to him.  "And pray how do I and these my friends around me
seem to you?'  "Thou art," he said, "a most excellent Ape, and all
these thy companions after thy example are excellent Apes too."
The King of the Apes, enraged at hearing these truths, gave him
over to the teeth and claws of his companions.  
 

The Wolf and the Shepherd 
 
A WOLF followed a flock of sheep for a long time and did not
attempt to injure one of them.  The Shepherd at first stood on
his guard against him, as against an enemy, and kept a strict
watch over his movements.  But when the Wolf, day after day, kept
in the company of the sheep and did not make the slightest effort
to seize them, the Shepherd began to look upon him as a guardian
of his flock rather than as a plotter of evil against it; and
when occasion called him one day into the city, he left the sheep
entirely in his charge.  The Wolf, now that he had the
opportunity, fell upon the sheep, and destroyed the greater part
of the flock.  When the Shepherd returned to find his flock
destroyed, he exclaimed:  "I have been rightly served; why did I
trust my sheep to a Wolf?'  
 

The Hares and the Lions 
 
THE HARES harangued the assembly, and argued that all should be
equal.  The Lions made this reply:  "Your words, O Hares! are
good; but they lack both claws and teeth such as we have."  
 

The Lark and Her Young Ones 
 
A LARK had made her nest in the early spring on the young green
wheat.  The brood had almost grown to their full strength and
attained the use of their wings and the full plumage of their
feathers, when the owner of the field, looking over his ripe
crop, said, "The time has come when I must ask all my neighbors
to help me with my harvest."  One of the young Larks heard his
speech and related it to his mother, inquiring of her to what
place they should move for safety.  "There is no occasion to move
yet, my son," she replied; "the man who only sends to his friends
to help him with his harvest is not really in earnest."  The owner
of the field came again a few days later and saw the wheat
shedding the grain from excess of ripeness.  He said, "I will
come myself tomorrow with my laborers, and with as many reapers
as I can hire, and will get in the harvest."  The Lark on hearing
these words said to her brood, "It is time now to be off, my
little ones, for the man is in earnest this time; he no longer
trusts his friends, but will reap the field himself."  
 
Self-help is the best help.  
 

The Fox and the Lion 
 
WHEN A FOX who had never yet seen a Lion, fell in with him by
chance for the first time in the forest, he was so frightened
that he nearly died with fear.  On meeting him for the second
time, he was still much alarmed, but not to the same extent as at
first.  On seeing him the third time, he so increased in boldness
that he went up to him and commenced a familiar conversation with
him.  
 
Acquaintance softens prejudices.  
 

The Weasel and the Mice 
 
A WEASEL, inactive from age and infirmities, was not able to
catch mice as he once did.  He therefore rolled himself in flour
and lay down in a dark corner.  A Mouse, supposing him to be
food, leaped upon him, and was instantly caught and squeezed to
death.  Another perished in a similar manner, and then a third,
and still others after them.  A very old Mouse, who had escaped
many a trap and snare, observed from a safe distance the trick of
his crafty foe and said, "Ah! you that lie there, may you prosper
just in the same proportion as you are what you pretend to be!"  
 

The Boy Bathing 
 
A BOY bathing in a river was in danger of being drowned.  He
called out to a passing traveler for help, but instead of holding
out a helping hand, the man stood by unconcernedly, and scolded
the boy for his imprudence.  "Oh, sir!"  cried the youth, "pray
help me now and scold me afterwards."  
 
Counsel without help is useless.  
 

The Ass and the Wolf 
 
AN ASS feeding in a meadow saw a Wolf approaching to seize him,
and immediately pretended to be lame.  The Wolf, coming up,
inquired the cause of his lameness.  The Ass replied that passing
through a hedge he had trod with his foot upon a sharp thorn.  He
requested that the Wolf pull it out, lest when he ate him it
should injure his throat.  The Wolf consented and lifted up the
foot, and was giving his whole mind to the discovery of the
thorn, when the Ass, with his heels, kicked his teeth into his
mouth and galloped away.  The Wolf, being thus fearfully mauled,
said, "I am rightly served, for why did I attempt the art of
healing, when my father only taught me the trade of a butcher?'  
 

The Seller of Images 
 
A CERTAIN MAN made a wooden image of Mercury and offered it for
sale.  When no one appeared willing to buy it, in order to
attract purchasers, he cried out that he had the statue to sell
of a benefactor who bestowed wealth and helped to heap up riches. 
One of the bystanders said to him, "My good fellow, why do you
sell him, being such a one as you describe, when you may yourself
enjoy the good things he has to give?'  "Why," he replied, "I am
in need of immediate help, and he is wont to give his good gifts
very slowly."  
 

The Fox and the Grapes 
 
A FAMISHED FOX saw some clusters of ripe black grapes hanging
from a trellised vine.  She resorted to all her tricks to get at
them, but wearied herself in vain, for she could not reach them. 
At last she turned away, hiding her disappointment and saying:
"The Grapes are sour, and not ripe as I thought."  
 

The Man and His Wife 
 
A MAN had a Wife who made herself hated by all the members of his
household.  Wishing to find out if she had the same effect on the
persons in her father's house, he made some excuse to send her
home on a visit to her father.  After a short time she returned,
and when he inquired how she had got on and how the servants had
treated her, she replied, "The herdsmen and shepherds cast on me
looks of aversion."  He said, "O Wife, if you were disliked by
those who go out early in the morning with their flocks and
return late in the evening, what must have been felt towards you
by those with whom you passed the whole day!"  
 
Straws show how the wind blows.  
 

The Peacock and Juno 
 
THE PEACOCK made complaint to Juno that, while the nightingale
pleased every ear with his song, he himself no sooner opened his
mouth than he became a laughingstock to all who heard him.  The
Goddess, to console him, said, "But you far excel in beauty and
in size.  The splendor of the emerald shines in your neck and you
unfold a tail gorgeous with painted plumage."  "But for what
purpose have I," said the bird, "this dumb beauty so long as I am
surpassed in song?'   "The lot of each," replied Juno, "has been
assigned by the will of the Fates--to thee, beauty; to the eagle, 
strength; to the nightingale, song; to the raven, favorable, 
and to the crow, unfavorable auguries.  These are all contented 
with the endowments allotted to them."  
 

The Hawk and the Nightingale 
 
A NIGHTINGALE, sitting aloft upon an oak and singing according to
his wont, was seen by a Hawk who, being in need of food, swooped
down and seized him.  The Nightingale, about to lose his life,
earnestly begged the Hawk to let him go, saying that he was not
big enough to satisfy the hunger of a Hawk who, if he wanted
food, ought to pursue the larger birds.  The Hawk, interrupting
him, said:  "I should indeed have lost my senses if I should let
go food ready in my hand, for the sake of pursuing birds which
are not yet even within sight."  
 

The Dog, the Cock, and the Fox 
 
A DOG and a Cock being great friends, agreed to travel together. 
At nightfall they took shelter in a thick wood.  The Cock flying
up, perched himself on the branches of a tree, while the Dog
found a bed beneath in the hollow trunk.  When the morning
dawned, the Cock, as usual, crowed very loudly several times.  A
Fox heard the sound, and wishing to make a breakfast on him, came
and stood under the branches, saying how earnestly he desired to
make the acquaintance of the owner of so magnificent a voice. 
The Cock, suspecting his civilities, said:  "Sir, I wish you would
do me the favor of going around to the hollow trunk below me, and
waking my porter, so that he may open the door and let you in."
When the Fox approached the tree, the Dog sprang out and caught
him, and tore him to pieces.  
 

The Wolf and the Goat 
 
A WOLF saw a Goat feeding at the summit of a steep precipice,
where he had no chance of reaching her.  He called to her and
earnestly begged her to come lower down, lest she fall by some
mishap; and he added that the meadows lay where he was standing,
and that the herbage was most tender.  She replied, "No, my
friend, it is not for the pasture that you invite me, but for
yourself, who are in want of food."  
 

The Lion and the Bull 
 
A LION, greatly desiring to capture a Bull, and yet afraid to
attack him on account of his great size, resorted to a trick to
ensure his destruction.  He approached the Bull and said, "I have
slain a fine sheep, my friend; and if you will come home and
partake of him with me, I shall be delighted to have your
company."  The Lion said this in the hope that, as the Bull was in
the act of reclining to eat, he might attack him to advantage,
and make his meal on him.  The Bull, on approaching the Lion's
den, saw the huge spits and giant caldrons, and no sign whatever
of the sheep, and, without saying a word, quietly took his
departure.  The Lion inquired why he went off so abruptly without
a word of salutation to his host, who had not given him any cause
for offense.  "I have reasons enough," said the Bull.  "I see no
indication whatever of your having slaughtered a sheep, while I
do see very plainly every preparation for your dining on a bull."

 

The Goat and the Ass 
 
A MAN once kept a Goat and an Ass.  The Goat, envying the Ass on
account of his greater abundance of food, said, "How shamefully
you are treated:  at one time grinding in the mill, and at another
carrying heavy burdens"; and he further advised him to pretend to
be epileptic and fall into a ditch and so obtain rest.  The Ass
listened to his words, and falling into a ditch, was very much
bruised.  His master, sending for a leech, asked his advice.  He
bade him pour upon the wounds the lungs of a Goat.  They at once
killed the Goat, and so healed the Ass.  
 

The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse 
 
A COUNTRY MOUSE invited a Town Mouse, an intimate friend, to pay
him a visit and partake of his country fare.  As they were on the
bare plowlands, eating there wheat-stocks and roots pulled up
from the hedgerow, the Town Mouse said to his friend, "You live
here the life of the ants, while in my house is the horn of
plenty.  I am surrounded by every luxury, and if you will come
with me, as I wish you would, you shall have an ample share of my
dainties."  The Country Mouse was easily persuaded, and returned
to town with his friend.  On his arrival, the Town Mouse placed
before him bread, barley, beans, dried figs, honey, raisins, and,
last of all, brought a dainty piece of cheese from a basket.  The
Country Mouse, being much delighted at the sight of such good
cheer, expressed his satisfaction in warm terms and lamented his
own hard fate.  Just as they were beginning to eat, someone
opened the door, and they both ran off squeaking, as fast as they
could, to a hole so narrow that two could only find room in it by
squeezing.  They had scarcely begun their repast again when
someone else entered to take something out of a cupboard,
whereupon the two Mice, more frightened than before, ran away and
hid themselves.  At last the Country Mouse, almost famished, said
to his friend:  "Although you have prepared for me so dainty a
feast, I must leave you to enjoy it by yourself.  It is
surrounded by too many dangers to please me.  I prefer my bare
plowlands and roots from the hedgerow, where I can live in
safety, and without fear."  
 

The Wolf, the Fox, and the Ape 
 
A WOLF accused a Fox of theft, but the Fox entirely denied the
charge.  An Ape undertook to adjudge the matter between them. 
When each had fully stated his case the Ape announced this
sentence:  "I do not think you, Wolf, ever lost what you claim;
and I do believe you, Fox, to have stolen what you so stoutly
deny."  
 
The dishonest, if they act honestly, get no credit.  
 

The Fly and the Draught-Mule 
 
A FLY sat on the axle-tree of a chariot, and addressing the
Draught-Mule said, "How slow you are! Why do you not go faster?
See if I do not prick your neck with my sting."  The Draught-Mule
replied, "I do not heed your threats; I only care for him who
sits above you, and who quickens my pace with his whip, or holds
me back with the reins.  Away, therefore, with your insolence,
for I know well when to go fast, and when to go slow."  
 

The Fishermen 
 
SOME FISHERMEN were out trawling their nets.  Perceiving them to
be very heavy, they danced about for joy and supposed that they
had taken a large catch.  When they had dragged the nets to the
shore they found but few fish:  the nets were full of sand and
stones, and the men were beyond measure cast downso much at the
disappointment which had befallen them, but because they had
formed such very different expectations.  One of their company,
an old man, said, "Let us cease lamenting, my mates, for, as it
seems to me, sorrow is always the twin sister of joy; and it was
only to be looked for that we, who just now were over-rejoiced,
should next have something to make us sad."  
 

The Lion and the Three Bulls 
 
THREE BULLS for a long time pastured together.  A Lion lay in
ambush in the hope of making them his prey, but was afraid to
attack them while they kept together.  Having at last by guileful
speeches succeeded in separating them, he attacked them without
fear as they fed alone, and feasted on them one by one at his own
leisure.  
 
Union is strength.  
 

The Fowler and the Viper 
 
A FOWLER, taking his bird-lime and his twigs, went out to catch
birds.  Seeing a thrush sitting upon a tree, he wished to take
it, and fitting his twigs to a proper length, watched intently,
having his whole thoughts directed towards the sky.  While thus
looking upwards, he unknowingly trod upon a Viper asleep just
before his feet.  The Viper, turning about, stung him, and
falling into a swoon, the man said to himself, "Woe is me! that
while I purposed to hunt another, I am myself fallen unawares
into the snares of death."  
 

The Horse and the Ass 
 
A HORSE, proud of his fine trappings, met an Ass on the highway. 
The Ass, being heavily laden, moved slowly out of the way. 
"Hardly," said the Horse, "can I resist kicking you with my
heels."  The Ass held his peace, and made only a silent appeal to
the justice of the gods.  Not long afterwards the Horse, having
become broken-winded, was sent by his owner to the farm.  The
Ass, seeing him drawing a dungcart, thus derided him:  "Where, O
boaster, are now all thy gay trappings, thou who are thyself
reduced to the condition you so lately treated with contempt?'  
 

The Fox and the Mask 
 
A FOX entered the house of an actor and, rummaging through all
his properties, came upon a Mask, an admirable imitation of a
human head.  He placed his paws on it and said, "What a beautiful
head! Yet it is of no value, as it entirely lacks brains."  
 

The Geese and the Cranes 
 
THE GEESE and the Cranes were feeding in the same meadow, when a
birdcatcher came to ensnare them in his nets.  The Cranes, being
light of wing, fled away at his approach; while the Geese, being
slower of flight and heavier in their bodies, were captured.  
 

The Blind Man and the Whelp 
 
A BLIND MAN was accustomed to distinguishing different animals by
touching them with his hands.  The whelp of a Wolf was brought
him, with a request that he would feel it, and say what it was. 
He felt it, and being in doubt, said:  "I do not quite know
whether it is the cub of a Fox, or the whelp of a Wolf, but this
I know full well.  It would not be safe to admit him to the
sheepfold."  
 
Evil tendencies are shown in early life.  
 

The Dogs and the Fox 
 
SOME DOGS, finding the skin of a lion, began to tear it in pieces
with their teeth.  A Fox, seeing them, said, "If this lion were
alive, you would soon find out that his claws were stronger than
your teeth."  
 
It is easy to kick a man that is down.  
 

The Cobbler Turned Doctor 
 
A COBBLER unable to make a living by his trade and made desperate
by poverty, began to practice medicine in a town in which he was
not known.  He sold a drug, pretending that it was an antidote to
all poisons, and obtained a great name for himself by long-winded
puffs and advertisements.  When the Cobbler happened to fall sick
himself of a serious illness, the Governor of the town determined
to test his skill.  For this purpose he called for a cup, and
while filling it with water, pretended to mix poison with the
Cobbler's antidote, commanding him to drink it on the promise of
a reward.  The Cobbler, under the fear of death, confessed that
he had no knowledge of medicine, and was only made famous by the
stupid clamors of the crowd.  The Governor then called a public
assembly and addressed the citizens:  "Of what folly have you been
guilty? You have not hesitated to entrust your heads to a man,
whom no one could employ to make even the shoes for their feet."

 
The Wolf and the Horse 
 
A WOLF coming out of a field of oats met a Horse and thus
addressed him:  "I would advise you to go into that field.  It is
full of fine oats, which I have left untouched for you, as you
are a friend whom I would love to hear enjoying good eating."  The
Horse replied, "If oats had been the food of wolves, you would
never have indulged your ears at the cost of your belly."  
 
Men of evil reputation, when they perform a good deed, fail to
get credit for it.  
 

The Brother and the Sister 
 
A FATHER had one son and one daughter, the former remarkable for
his good looks, the latter for her extraordinary ugliness.  While
they were playing one day as children, they happened by chance to
look together into a mirror that was placed on their mother's
chair.  The boy congratulated himself on his good looks; the girl
grew angry, and could not bear the self-praises of her Brother,
interpreting all he said (and how could she do otherwise?) into
reflection on herself.  She ran off to her father.  to be avenged
on her Brother, and spitefully accused him of having, as a boy,
made use of that which belonged only to girls.  The father
embraced them both, and bestowing his kisses and affection
impartially on each, said, "I wish you both would look into the
mirror every day:  you, my son, that you may not spoil your beauty
by evil conduct; and you, my daughter, that you may make up for
your lack of beauty by your virtues."  
 

The Wasps, the Partridges, and the Farmer 
 
THE WASPS and the Partridges, overcome with thirst, came to a
Farmer and besought him to give them some water to drink.  They
promised amply to repay him the favor which they asked.  The
Partridges declared that they would dig around his vines and make
them produce finer grapes.  The Wasps said that they would keep
guard and drive off thieves with their stings.  But the Farmer
interrupted them, saying:  "I have already two oxen, who, without
making any promises, do all these things.  It is surely better
for me to give the water to them than to you."  
 

The Crow and Mercury 
 
A CROW caught in a snare prayed to Apollo to release him, making
a vow to offer some frankincense at his shrine.  But when rescued
from his danger, he forgot his promise.  Shortly afterwards,
again caught in a snare, he passed by Apollo and made the same
promise to offer frankincense to Mercury.  Mercury soon appeared
and said to him, "O thou most base fellow? how can I believe
thee, who hast disowned and wronged thy former patron?'  
 

The North Wind and the Sun 
 
THE NORTH WIND and the Sun disputed as to which was the most
powerful, and agreed that he should be declared the victor who
could first strip a wayfaring man of his clothes.  The North Wind
first tried his power and blew with all his might, but the keener
his blasts, the closer the Traveler wrapped his cloak around him,
until at last, resigning all hope of victory, the Wind called
upon the Sun to see what he could do.  The Sun suddenly shone out
with all his warmth.  The Traveler no sooner felt his genial rays
than he took off one garment after another, and at last, fairly
overcome with heat, undressed and bathed in a stream that lay in
his path.  
 
Persuasion is better than Force.  
 

The Two Men Who Were Enemies 
 
TWO MEN, deadly enemies to each other, were sailing in the same
vessel.  Determined to keep as far apart as possible, the one
seated himself in the stem, and the other in the prow of the
ship.  A violent storm arose, and with the vessel in great danger
of sinking, the one in the stern inquired of the pilot which of
the two ends of the ship would go down first.  On his replying
that he supposed it would be the prow, the Man said, "Death would
not be grievous to me, if I could only see my Enemy die before
me."  
 

The Gamecocks and the Partridge 
 
A MAN had two Gamecocks in his poultry-yard.  One day by chance
he found a tame Partridge for sale.  He purchased it and brought
it home to be reared with his Gamecocks.  When the Partridge was
put into the poultry-yard, they struck at it and followed it
about, so that the Partridge became grievously troubled and
supposed that he was thus evilly treated because he was a
stranger.  Not long afterwards he saw the Cocks fighting together
and not separating before one had well beaten the other.  He then
said to himself, "I shall no longer distress myself at being
struck at by these Gamecocks, when I see that they cannot even
refrain from quarreling with each other."  
 

The Quack Frog 
 
A FROG once upon a time came forth from his home in the marsh and
proclaimed to all the beasts that he was a learned physician,
skilled in the use of drugs and able to heal all diseases.  A Fox
asked him, "How can you pretend to prescribe for others, when you
are unable to heal your own lame gait and wrinkled skin?'  
 

The Lion, the Wolf, and the Fox 
 
A LION, growing old, lay sick in his cave.  All the beasts came
to visit their king, except the Fox.  The Wolf therefore,
thinking that he had a capital opportunity, accused the Fox to
the Lion of not paying any respect to him who had the rule over
them all and of not coming to visit him.  At that very moment the
Fox came in and heard these last words of the Wolf.  The Lion
roaring out in a rage against him, the Fox sought an opportunity
to defend himself and said, "And who of all those who have come
to you have benefited you so much as I, who have traveled from
place to place in every direction, and have sought and learnt
from the physicians the means of healing you?'  The Lion commanded
him immediately to tell him the cure, when he replied, "You must
flay a wolf alive and wrap his skin yet warm around you."  The
Wolf was at once taken and flayed; whereon the Fox, turning to
him, said with a smile, "You should have moved your master not to
ill, but to good, will."  
 

The Dog's House 
 
IN THE WINTERTIME, a Dog curled up in as small a space as
possible on account of the cold, determined to make himself a
house.  However when the summer returned again, he lay asleep
stretched at his full length and appeared to himself to be of a
great size.  Now he considered that it would be neither an easy
nor a necessary work to make himself such a house as would
accommodate him.  
 

The Wolf and the Lion 
 
ROAMING BY the mountainside at sundown, a Wolf saw his own shadow
become greatly extended and magnified, and he said to himself,
"Why should I, being of such an immense size and extending nearly
an acre in length, be afraid of the Lion? Ought I not to be
acknowledged as King of all the collected beasts?'  While he was
indulging in these proud thoughts, a Lion fell upon him and
killed him.  He exclaimed with a too late repentance, "Wretched
me! this overestimation of myself is the cause of my
destruction."  
 

The Birds, the Beasts, and the Bat 
 
THE BIRDS waged war with the Beasts, and each were by turns the
conquerors.  A Bat, fearing the uncertain issues of the fight,
always fought on the side which he felt was the strongest.  When
peace was proclaimed, his deceitful conduct was apparent to both
combatants.  Therefore being condemned by each for his treachery,
he was driven forth from the light of day, and henceforth
concealed himself in dark hiding-places, flying always alone and
at night.  
 

The Spendthrift and the Swallow 
 
A YOUNG MAN, a great spendthrift, had run through all his
patrimony and had but one good cloak left.  One day he happened
to see a Swallow, which had appeared before its season, skimming
along a pool and twittering gaily.  He supposed that summer had
come, and went and sold his cloak.  Not many days later, winter
set in again with renewed frost and cold.  When he found the
unfortunate Swallow lifeless on the ground, he said, "Unhappy
bird! what have you done? By thus appearing before the springtime
you have not only killed yourself, but you have wrought my
destruction also."  
 

The Fox and the Lion 
 
A FOX saw a Lion confined in a cage, and standing near him,
bitterly reviled him.  The Lion said to the Fox, "It is not thou
who revilest me; but this mischance which has befallen me."  
 

The Owl and the Birds 
 
AN OWL, in her wisdom, counseled the Birds that when the acorn
first began to sprout, to pull it all up out of the ground and
not allow it to grow.  She said acorns would produce mistletoe,
from which an irremediable poison, the bird- 
lime, would be extracted and by which they would be captured. 
The Owl next advised them to pluck up the seed of the flax, which
men had sown, as it was a plant which boded no good to them. 
And, lastly, the Owl, seeing an archer approach, predicted that
this man, being on foot, would contrive darts armed with feathers
which would fly faster than the wings of the Birds themselves. 
The Birds gave no credence to these warning words, but considered
the Owl to be beside herself and said that she was mad.  But
afterwards, finding her words were true, they wondered at her
knowledge and deemed her to be the wisest of birds.  Hence it is
that when she appears they look to her as knowing all things,
while she no longer gives them advice, but in solitude laments
their past folly.  
 

The Trumpeter Taken Prisoner 
 
A TRUMPETER, bravely leading on the soldiers, was captured by the
enemy.  He cried out to his captors, "Pray spare me, and do not
take my life without cause or without inquiry.  I have not slain
a single man of your troop.  I have no arms, and carry nothing
but this one brass trumpet."  "That is the very reason for which
you should be put to death," they said; "for, while you do not
fight yourself, your trumpet stirs all the others to battle."  
 

The Ass in the Lion's Skin 
 
AN ASS, having put on the Lion's skin, roamed about in the forest
and amused himself by frightening all the foolish animals he met
in his wanderings.  At last coming upon a Fox, he tried to
frighten him also, but the Fox no sooner heard the sound of his
voice than he exclaimed, "I might possibly have been frightened
myself, if I had not heard your bray."  
 

The Sparrow and the Hare 
 
A HARE pounced upon by an eagle sobbed very much and uttered
cries like a child.  A Sparrow upbraided her and said, "Where now
is thy remarkable swiftness of foot? Why were your feet so slow?"
While the Sparrow was thus speaking, a hawk suddenly seized him
and killed him.  The Hare was comforted in her death, and
expiring said, "Ah! you who so lately, when you supposed yourself
safe, exulted over my calamity, have now reason to deplore a
similar misfortune."  
 

The Flea and the Ox 
 
A FLEA thus questioned an Ox:  "What ails you, that being so huge
and strong, you submit to the wrongs you receive from men and
slave for them day by day, while I, being so small a creature,
mercilessly feed on their flesh and drink their blood without
stint?'  The Ox replied:  "I do not wish to be ungrateful, for I am
loved and well cared for by men, and they often pat my head and
shoulders."  "Woe's me!"  said the flea; "this very patting which
you like, whenever it happens to me, brings with it my inevitable
destruction."  
 

The Goods and the Ills 
 
ALL the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that common
share which they each had in the affairs of mankind; for the Ills
by reason of their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth. 
The Goods wafted themselves to heaven and asked for a righteous
vengeance on their persecutors.  They entreated Jupiter that they
might no longer be associated with the Ills, as they had nothing
in common and could not live together, but were engaged in
unceasing warfare; and that an indissoluble law might be laid
down for their future protection.  Jupiter granted their request
and decreed that henceforth the Ills should visit the earth in
company with each other, but that the Goods should one by one
enter the habitations of men.  Hence it arises that Ills abound,
for they come not one by one, but in troops, and by no means
singly:  while the Goods proceed from Jupiter, and are given, not
alike to all, but singly, and separately; and one by one to those
who are able to discern them.  
 

The Dove and the Crow 
 
A DOVE shut up in a cage was boasting of the large number of
young ones which she had hatched.  A Crow hearing her, said:  "My
good friend, cease from this unseasonable boasting.  The larger
the number of your family, the greater your cause of sorrow, in
seeing them shut up in this prison-house."  
 

Mercury and the Workmen 
 
A WORKMAN, felling wood by the side of a river, let his axe drop
- by accident into a deep pool.  Being thus deprived of the means
of his livelihood, he sat down on the bank and lamented his hard
fate.  Mercury appeared and demanded the cause of his tears. 
After he told him his misfortune, Mercury plunged into the
stream, and, bringing up a golden axe, inquired if that were the
one he had lost.  On his saying that it was not his, Mercury
disappeared beneath the water a second time, returned with a
silver axe in his hand, and again asked the Workman if it were
his.  When the Workman said it was not, he dived into the pool
for the third time and brought up the axe that had been lost. 
The Workman claimed it and expressed his joy at its recovery. 
Mercury, pleased with his honesty, gave him the golden and silver
axes in addition to his own.    The Workman, on his return to his
house, related to his companions all that had happened.  One of
them at once resolved to try and secure the same good fortune for
himself.  He ran to the river and threw his axe on purpose into
the pool at the same place, and sat down on the bank to weep. 
Mercury appeared to him just as he hoped he would; and having
learned the cause of his grief, plunged into the stream and
brought up a golden axe, inquiring if he had lost it.  The
Workman seized it greedily, and declared that truly it was the
very same axe that he had lost.  Mercury, displeased at his
knavery, not only took away the golden axe, but refused to
recover for him the axe he had thrown into the pool.  
 

The Eagle and the Jackdaw 
 
AN EAGLE, flying down from his perch on a lofty rock, seized upon
a lamb and carried him aloft in his talons.  A Jackdaw, who
witnessed the capture of the lamb, was stirred with envy and
determined to emulate the strength and flight of the Eagle.  He
flew around with a great whir of his wings and settled upon a
large ram, with the intention of carrying him off, but his claws
became entangled in the ram's fleece and he was not able to
release himself, although he fluttered with his feathers as much
as he could.  The shepherd, seeing what had happened, ran up and
caught him.  He at once clipped the Jackdaw's wings, and taking
him home at night, gave him to his children.  On their saying,
"Father, what kind of bird is it?'  he replied, "To my certain
knowledge he is a Daw; but he would like you to think an Eagle."

 

The Fox and the Crane 
 
A FOX invited a Crane to supper and provided nothing for his
entertainment but some soup made of pulse, which was poured out
into a broad flat stone dish.  The soup fell out of the long bill
of the Crane at every mouthful, and his vexation at not being
able to eat afforded the Fox much amusement.  The Crane, in his
turn, asked the Fox to sup with him, and set before her a flagon
with a long narrow mouth, so that he could easily insert his neck
and enjoy its contents at his leisure.  The Fox, unable even to
taste it, met with a fitting requital, after the fashion of her
own hospitality.   


Jupiter, Neptune, Minerva, and Momus 
 
ACCORDING to an ancient legend, the first man was made by
Jupiter, the first bull by Neptune, and the first house by
Minerva.  On the completion of their labors, a dispute arose as
to which had made the most perfect work.  They agreed to appoint
Momus as judge, and to abide by his decision.  Momus, however,
being very envious of the handicraft of each, found fault with
all.  He first blamed the work of Neptune because he had not made
the horns of the bull below his eyes, so he might better see
where to strike.  He then condemned the work of Jupiter, because
he had not placed the heart of man on the outside, that everyone
might read the thoughts of the evil disposed and take precautions
against the intended mischief.  And, lastly, he inveighed against
Minerva because she had not contrived iron wheels in the
foundation of her house, so its inhabitants might more easily
remove if a neighbor proved unpleasant.  Jupiter, indignant at
such inveterate faultfinding, drove him from his office of judge,
and expelled him from the mansions of Olympus.  
 

The Eagle and the Fox 
 
AN EAGLE and a Fox formed an intimate friendship and decided to
live near each other.  The Eagle built her nest in the branches
of a tall tree, while the Fox crept into the underwood and there
produced her young.  Not long after they had agreed upon this
plan, the Eagle, being in want of provision for her young ones,
swooped down while the Fox was out, seized upon one of the little
cubs, and feasted herself and her brood.  The Fox on her return,
discovered what had happened, but was less grieved for the death
of her young than for her inability to avenge them.  A just
retribution, however, quickly fell upon the Eagle.  While
hovering near an altar, on which some villagers were sacrificing
a goat, she suddenly seized a piece of the flesh, and carried it,
along with a burning cinder, to her nest.  A strong breeze soon
fanned the spark into a flame, and the eaglets, as yet unfledged
and helpless, were roasted in their nest and dropped down dead at
the bottom of the tree.  There, in the sight of the Eagle, the
Fox gobbled them up.  
 

The Man and the Satyr 
 
A MAN and a Satyr once drank together in token of a bond of
alliance being formed between them.  One very cold wintry day, as
they talked, the Man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on
them.  When the Satyr asked the reason for this, he told him that
he did it to warm his hands because they were so cold.  Later on
in the day they sat down to eat, and the food prepared was quite
scalding.  The Man raised one of the dishes a little towards his
mouth and blew in it.  When the Satyr again inquired the reason,
he said that he did it to cool the meat, which was too hot.  "I
can no longer consider you as a friend," said the Satyr, "a
fellow who with the same breath blows hot and cold."  
 

The Ass and His Purchaser 
 
A MAN wished to purchase an Ass, and agreed with its owner that
he should try out the animal before he bought him.  He took the
Ass home and put him in the straw-yard with his other Asses, upon
which the new animal left all the others and at once joined the
one that was most idle and the greatest eater of them all. 
Seeing this, the man put a halter on him and led him back to his
owner.  On being asked how, in so short a time, he could have
made a trial of him, he answered, "I do not need a trial; I know
that he will be just the same as the one he chose for his
companion."  
 
A man is known by the company he keeps.  
 

The Two Bags 
 
EVERY MAN, according to an ancient legend, is born into the world
with two bags suspended from his neck   all bag in front full of
his neighbors' faults, and a large bag behind filled with his own
faults.  Hence it is that men are quick to see the faults of
others, and yet are often blind to their own failings.  
 

The Stag at the Pool 
 
A STAG overpowered by heat came to a spring to drink.  Seeing his
own shadow reflected in the water, he greatly admired the size
and variety of his horns, but felt angry with himself for having
such slender and weak feet.  While he was thus contemplating
himself, a Lion appeared at the pool and crouched to spring upon
him.  The Stag immediately took to flight, and exerting his
utmost speed, as long as the plain was smooth and open kept
himself easily at a safe distance from the Lion.  But entering a
wood he became entangled by his horns, and the Lion quickly came
up to him and caught him.  When too late, he thus reproached
himself:  "Woe is me! How I have deceived myself! These feet which
would have saved me I despised, and I gloried in these antlers
which have proved my destruction."  
 
What is most truly valuable is often underrated.  
 

The Jackdaw and the Fox 
 
A HALF-FAMISHED JACKDAW seated himself on a fig-tree, which had
produced some fruit entirely out of season, and waited in the
hope that the figs would ripen.  A Fox seeing him sitting so long
and learning the reason of his doing so, said to him, "You are
indeed, sir, sadly deceiving yourself; you are indulging a hope
strong enough to cheat you, but which will never reward you with
enjoyment."  
 

The Lark Burying Her Father 
 
THE LARK (according to an ancient legend) was created before the
earth itself, and when her father died, as there was no earth,
she could find no place of burial for him.  She let him lie
uninterred for five days, and on the sixth day, not knowing what
else to do, she buried him in her own head.  Hence she obtained
her crest, which is popularly said to be her father's
grave-hillock.  
 
Youth's first duty is reverence to parents.  
 

The Gnat and the Bull 
 
A GNAT settled on the horn of a Bull, and sat there a long time. 
Just as he was about to fly off, he made a buzzing noise, and
inquired of the Bull if he would like him to go.  The Bull
replied, "I did not know you had come, and I shall not miss you
when you go away."  
 
Some men are of more consequence in their own eyes than in the
eyes of their neighbors.  
 

The Bitch and Her Whelps 
 
A BITCH, ready to whelp, earnestly begged a shepherd for a place
where she might litter.  When her request was granted, she
besought permission to rear her puppies in the same spot.  The
shepherd again consented.  But at last the Bitch, protected by
the bodyguard of her Whelps, who had now grown up and were able
to defend themselves, asserted her exclusive right to the place
and would not permit the shepherd to approach.  
 

The Dogs and the Hides 
 
SOME DOGS famished with hunger saw a number of cowhides steeping
in a river.  Not being able to reach them, they agreed to drink
up the river, but it happened that they burst themselves with
drinking long before they reached the hides.  
 
Attempt not impossibilities.  
 

The Shepherd and the Sheep 
 
A SHEPHERD driving his Sheep to a wood, saw an oak of unusual
size full of acorns, and spreading his cloak under the branches,
he climbed up into the tree and shook them down.  The Sheep
eating the acorns inadvertently frayed and tore the cloak.  When
the Shepherd came down and saw what was done, he said, "O you
most ungrateful creatures! You provide wool to make garments for
all other men, but you destroy the clothes of him who feeds you."

 

The Grasshopper and the Owl 
 
AN OWL, accustomed to feed at night and to sleep during the day,
was greatly disturbed by the noise of a Grasshopper and earnestly
besought her to stop chirping.  The Grasshopper refused to
desist, and chirped louder and louder the more the Owl entreated. 
When she saw that she could get no redress and that her words
were despised, the Owl attacked the chatterer by a stratagem. 
"Since I cannot sleep," she said, "on account of your song which,
believe me, is sweet as the lyre of Apollo, I shall indulge
myself in drinking some nectar which Pallas lately gave me.  If
you do not dislike it, come to me and we will drink it together."
The Grasshopper, who was thirsty, and pleased with the praise of
her voice, eagerly flew up.  The Owl came forth from her hollow,
seized her, and put her to death.  
 

The Monkey and the Camel 
 
THE BEASTS of the forest gave a splendid entertainment at which
the Monkey stood up and danced.  Having vastly delighted the
assembly, he sat down amidst universal applause.  The Camel,
envious of the praises bestowed on the Monkey and desiring to
divert to himself the favor of the guests, proposed to stand up
in his turn and dance for their amusement.  He moved about in so
utterly ridiculous a manner that the Beasts, in a fit of
indignation, set upon him with clubs and drove him out of the
assembly.  
 
It is absurd to ape our betters.  
 

The Peasant and the Apple-Tree 
 
A PEASANT had in his garden an Apple-Tree which bore no fruit but
only served as a harbor for the sparrows and grasshoppers.  He
resolved to cut it down, and taking his axe in his hand, made a
bold stroke at its roots.  The grasshoppers and sparrows
entreated him not to cut down the tree that sheltered them, but
to spare it, and they would sing to him and lighten his labors. 
He paid no attention to their request, but gave the tree a second
and a third blow with his axe.  When he reached the hollow of the
tree, he found a hive full of honey.  Having tasted the
honeycomb, he threw down his axe, and looking on the tree as
sacred, took great care of it.  
 
Self-interest alone moves some men.  
 

The Two Soldiers and the Robber 
 
TWO SOLDIERS traveling together were set upon by a Robber.  The
one fled away; the other stood his ground and defended himself
with his stout right hand.  The Robber being slain, the timid
companion ran up and drew his sword, and then, throwing back his
traveling cloak said, "I'll at him, and I'll take care he shall
learn whom he has attacked."  On this, he who had fought with the
Robber made answer, "I only wish that you had helped me just now,
even if it had been only with those words, for I should have been
the more encouraged, believing them to be true; but now put up
your sword in its sheath and hold your equally useless tongue,
till you can deceive others who do not know you.  I, indeed, who
have experienced with what speed you run away, know right well
that no dependence can be placed on your valor."  
 

The Trees Under the Protection of the Gods 
 
THE GODS, according to an ancient legend, made choice of certain
trees to be under their special protection.  Jupiter chose the
oak, Venus the myrtle, Apollo the laurel, Cybele the pine, and
Hercules the poplar.  Minerva, wondering why they had preferred
trees not yielding fruit, inquired the reason for their choice. 
Jupiter replied, "It is lest we should seem to covet the honor
for the fruit."  But said Minerva, "Let anyone say what he will
the olive is more dear to me on account of its fruit."  Then said
Jupiter, "My daughter, you are rightly called wise; for unless
what we do is useful, the glory of it is vain."  
 

The Mother and the Wolf 
 
A FAMISHED WOLF was prowling about in the morning in search of
food.  As he passed the door of a cottage built in the forest, he
heard a Mother say to her child, "Be quiet, or I will throw you
out of the window, and the Wolf shall eat you."  The Wolf sat all
day waiting at the door.  In the evening he heard the same woman
fondling her child and saying:  "You are quiet now, and if the
Wolf should come, we will kill him."  The Wolf, hearing these
words, went home, gasping with cold and hunger.  When he reached
his den, Mistress Wolf inquired of him why he returned wearied
and supperless, so contrary to his wont.  He replied:  "Why,
forsooth!
use I gave credence to the words of a woman!"  
 

The Ass and the Horse 
 
AN ASS besought a Horse to spare him a small portion of his feed. 
"Yes," said the Horse; "if any remains out of what I am now
eating I will give it you for the sake of my own superior
dignity, and if you will come when I reach my own stall in the
evening, I will give you a little sack full of barley."  The Ass
replied, "Thank you.  But I can't think that you, who refuse me a
little matter now.  will by and by confer on me a greater
benefit."  
 

Truth and the Traveler 
 
A WAYFARING MAN, traveling in the desert, met a woman standing
alone and terribly dejected.  He inquired of her, "Who art thou?"
"My name is Truth," she replied.  "And for what cause," he asked,
"have you left the city to dwell alone here in the wilderness?"
She made answer, "Because in former times, falsehood was with
few, but is now with all men."  
 
The Manslayer 
 
A MAN committed a murder, and was pursued by the relations of the
man whom he murdered.  On his reaching the river Nile he saw a
Lion on its bank and being fearfully afraid, climbed up a tree. 
He found a serpent in the upper branches of the tree, and again
being greatly alarmed, he threw himself into the river, where a
crocodile caught him and ate him.  Thus the earth, the air, and
the water alike refused shelter to a murderer.  
 
The Lion and the Fox 
 
A FOX entered into partnership with a Lion on the pretense of
becoming his servant.  Each undertook his proper duty in
accordance with his own nature and powers.  The Fox discovered
and pointed out the prey; the Lion sprang on it and seized it. 
The Fox soon became jealous of the Lion carrying off the Lion's
share, and said that he would no longer find out the prey, but
would capture it on his own account.  The next day he attempted
to snatch a lamb from the fold, but he himself fell prey to the
huntsmen and hounds.  
 
The Lion and the Eagle 
 
AN EAGLE stayed his flight and entreated a Lion to make an
alliance with him to their mutual advantage.  The Lion replied,
"I have no objection, but you must excuse me for requiring you to
find surety for your good faith, for how can I trust anyone as a
friend who is able to fly away from his bargain whenever he
pleases?'  
 
Try before you trust.  
 
The Hen and the Swallow 
 
A HEN finding the eggs of a viper and carefully keeping them
warm, nourished them into life.  A Swallow, observing what she
had done, said, "You silly creature! why have you hatched these
vipers which, when they shall have grown, will inflict injury on
all, beginning with yourself?'  
 
The Buffoon and the Countryman 
 
A RICH NOBLEMAN once opened the theaters without charge to the
people, and gave a public notice that he would handsomely reward
any person who invented a new amusement for the occasion. 
Various public performers contended for the prize.  Among them
came a Buffoon well known among the populace for his jokes, and
said that he had a kind of entertainment which had never been
brought out on any stage before.  This report being spread about
made a great stir, and the theater was crowded in every part. 
The Buffoon appeared alone upon the platform, without any
apparatus or confederates, and the very sense of expectation
caused an intense silence.  He suddenly bent his head towards his
bosom and imitated the squeaking of a little pig so admirably
with his voice that the audience declared he had a porker under
his cloak, and demanded that it should be shaken out.  When that
was done and nothing was found, they cheered the actor, and
loaded him with the loudest applause.  A Countryman in the crowd,
observing all that has passed, said, "So help me, Hercules, he
shall not beat me at that trick!"  and at once proclaimed that he
would do the same thing on the next day, though in a much more
natural way.  On the morrow a still larger crowd assembled in the
theater, but now partiality for their favorite actor very
generally prevailed, and the audience came rather to ridicule the
Countryman than to see the spectacle.  Both of the performers
appeared on the stage.  The Buffoon grunted and squeaked away
first, and obtained, as on the preceding day, the applause and
cheers of the spectators.  Next the Countryman commenced, and
pretending that he concealed a little pig beneath his clothes
(which in truth he did, but not suspected by the audience )
contrived to take hold of and to pull his ear causing the pig to
squeak.  The Crowd, however, cried out with one consent that the
Buffoon had given a far more exact imitation, and clamored for
the Countryman to be kicked out of the theater.  On this the
rustic produced the little pig from his cloak and showed by the
most positive proof the greatness of their mistake.  "Look here,"
he said, "this shows what sort of judges you are."  
 
The Crow and the Serpent 
 
A CROW in great want of food saw a Serpent asleep in a sunny
nook, and flying down, greedily seized him.  The Serpent, turning
about, bit the Crow with a mortal wound.  In the agony of death,
the bird exclaimed:  "O unhappy me! who have found in that which I
deemed a happy windfall the source of my destruction."  
 
The Hunter and the Horseman 
 
A CERTAIN HUNTER, having snared a hare, placed it upon his
shoulders and set out homewards.  On his way he met a man on
horseback who begged the hare of him, under the pretense of
purchasing it.  However, when the Horseman got the hare, he rode
off as fast as he could.  The Hunter ran after him, as if he was
sure of overtaking him, but the Horseman increased more and more
the distance between them.  The Hunter, sorely against his will,
called out to him and said, "Get along with you! for I will now
make you a present of the hare."  
 
The King's Son and the Painted Lion 
 
A KING, whose only son was fond of martial exercises, had a dream
in which he was warned that his son would be killed by a lion. 
Afraid the dream should prove true, he built for his son a
pleasant palace and adorned its walls for his amusement with all
kinds of life-sized animals, among which was the picture of a
lion.  When the young Prince saw this, his grief at being thus
confined burst out afresh, and, standing near the lion, he said:
"O you most detestable of animals! through a lying dream of my
father's, which he saw in his sleep, I am shut up on your account
in this palace as if I had been a girl:  what shall I now do to
you?'  With these words he stretched out his hands toward a
thorn-tree, meaning to cut a stick from its branches so that he
might beat the lion.  But one of the tree's prickles pierced his
finger and caused great pain and inflammation, so that the young
Prince fell down in a fainting fit.  A violent fever suddenly set
in, from which he died not many days later.  
 
We had better bear our troubles bravely than try to escape them. 

 
The Cat and Venus 
 
A CAT fell in love with a handsome young man, and entreated Venus
to change her into the form of a woman.  Venus consented to her
request and transformed her into a beautiful damsel, so that the
youth saw her and loved her, and took her home as his bride. 
While the two were reclining in their chamber, Venus wishing to
discover if the Cat in her change of shape had also altered her
habits of life, let down a mouse in the middle of the room.  The
Cat, quite forgetting her present condition, started up from the
couch and pursued the mouse, wishing to eat it.  Venus was much
disappointed and again caused her to return to her former shape. 

 
Nature exceeds nurture.  
 

The She-Goats and Their Beards 
 
THE SHE-GOATS having obtained a beard by request to Jupiter, the
He-Goats were sorely displeased and made complaint that the
females equaled them in dignity.  "Allow them," said Jupiter, "to
enjoy an empty honor and to assume the badge of your nobler sex,
so long as they are not your equals in strength or courage."  
 
It matters little if those who are inferior to us in merit should
be like us in outside appearances.  
 
The Camel and the Arab 
 
AN ARAB CAMEL-DRIVER, after completing the loading of his Camel,
asked him which he would like best, to go up hill or down.  The
poor beast replied, not without a touch of reason:  "Why do you
ask me? Is it that the level way through the desert is closed?"

 
The Miller, His Son, and Their Ass 
 
A MILLER and his son were driving their Ass to a neighboring fair
to sell him.  They had not gone far when they met with a troop of
women collected round a well, talking and laughing.  "Look
there," cried one of them, "did you ever see such fellows, to be
trudging along the road on foot when they might ride?'  The old
man hearing this, quickly made his son mount the Ass, and
continued to walk along merrily by his side.  Presently they came
up to a group of old men in earnest debate.  "There," said one of
them, "it proves what I was a-saying.  What respect is shown to
old age in these days? Do you see that idle lad riding while his
old father has to walk? Get down, you young scapegrace, and let
the old man rest his weary limbs."  Upon this the old man made his
son dismount, and got up himself.  In this manner they had not
proceeded far when they met a company of women and children:
"Why, you lazy old fellow," cried several tongues at once, "how
can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there can
hardly keep pace by the side of you?'  The good-natured Miller
immediately took up his son behind him.  They had now almost
reached the town.    "Pray, honest friend," said a citizen, "is
that Ass your own?'  "Yes," replied the old man.  "O, one would
not have thought so," said the other, "by the way you load him. 
Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than
he you."  "Anything to please you," said the old man; "we can but
try."  So, alighting with his son, they tied the legs of the Ass
together and with the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on
their shoulders over a bridge near the entrance to the town. 
This entertaining sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at
it, till the Ass, not liking the noise nor the strange handling
that he was subject to, broke the cords that bound him and,
tumbling off the pole, fell into the river.  Upon this, the old
man, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again,
convinced that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased
nobody, and lost his Ass in the bargain.  
 
The Crow and the Sheep 
 
A TROUBLESOME CROW seated herself on the back of a Sheep.  The
Sheep, much against his will, carried her backward and forward
for a long time, and at last said, "If you had treated a dog in
this way, you would have had your deserts from his sharp teeth."
To this the Crow replied, "I despise the weak and yield to the
strong.  I know whom I may bully and whom I must flatter; and I
thus prolong my life to a good old age."  
 
The Fox and the Bramble 
 
A FOX was mounting a hedge when he lost his footing and caught
hold of a Bramble to save himself.  Having pricked and grievously
tom the soles of his feet, he accused the Bramble because, when
he had fled to her for assistance, she had used him worse than
the hedge itself.  The Bramble, interrupting him, said, "But you
really must have been out of your senses to fasten yourself on
me, who am myself always accustomed to fasten upon others."  
 
The Wolf and the Lion 
 
A WOLF, having stolen a lamb from a fold, was carrying him off to
his lair.  A Lion met him in the path, and seizing the lamb, took
it from him.  Standing at a safe distance, the Wolf exclaimed,
"You have unrighteously taken that which was mine from me!"  To
which the Lion jeeringly replied, "It was righteously yours, eh?
The gift of a friend?'  
 
The Dog and the Oyster 
 
A DOG, used to eating eggs, saw an Oyster and, opening his mouth
to its widest extent, swallowed it down with the utmost relish,
supposing it to be an egg.  Soon afterwards suffering great pain
in his stomach, he said, "I deserve all this torment, for my
folly in thinking that everything round must be an egg."  
 
They who act without sufficient thought, will often fall into
unsuspected danger.  
 
The Ant and the Dove 
 
AN ANT went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and
being carried away by the rush of the stream, was on the point of
drowning.  A Dove sitting on a tree overhanging the water plucked
a leaf and let it fall into the stream close to her.  The Ant
climbed onto it and floated in safety to the bank.  Shortly
afterwards a birdcatcher came and stood under the tree, and laid
his lime-twigs for the Dove, which sat in the branches.  The Ant,
perceiving his design, stung him in the foot.  In pain the
birdcatcher threw down the twigs, and the noise made the Dove
take wing.  
 
The Partridge and the Fowler 
 
A FOWLER caught a Partridge and was about to kill it.  The
Partridge earnestly begged him to spare his life, saying, "Pray,
master, permit me to live and I will entice many Partridges to
you in recompense for your mercy to me."  The Fowler replied, "I
shall now with less scruple take your life, because you are
willing to save it at the cost of betraying your friends and
relations."  
 
The Flea and the Man 
 
A MAN, very much annoyed with a Flea, caught him at last, and
said, "Who are you who dare to feed on my limbs, and to cost me
so much trouble in catching you?'  The Flea replied, "O my dear
sir, pray spare my life, and destroy me not, for I cannot
possibly do you much harm."  The Man, laughing, replied, "Now you
shall certainly die by mine own hands, for no evil, whether it be
small or large, ought to be tolerated."  
 
The Thieves and the Cock 
 
SOME THIEVES broke into a house and found nothing but a Cock,
whom they stole, and got off as fast as they could.  Upon
arriving at home they prepared to kill the Cock, who thus pleaded
for his life:  "Pray spare me; I am very serviceable to men.  I
wake them up in the night to their work."  "That is the very
reason why we must the more kill you," they replied; "for when
you wake your neighbors, you entirely put an end to our
business."  
 
The safeguards of virtue are hateful to those with evil
intentions.  
 
The Dog and the Cook 
 
A RICH MAN gave a great feast, to which he invited many friends
and acquaintances.  His Dog availed himself of the occasion to
invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, "My master gives
a feast, and there is always much food remaining; come and sup
with me tonight."  The Dog thus invited went at the hour
appointed, and seeing the preparations for so grand an
entertainment, said in the joy of his heart, "How glad I am that
I came! I do not often get such a chance as this.  I will take
care and eat enough to last me both today and tomorrow."  While he
was congratulating himself and wagging his tail to convey his
pleasure to his friend, the Cook saw him moving about among his
dishes and, seizing him by his fore and hind paws, bundled him
without ceremony out of the window.  He fell with force upon the
ground and limped away, howling dreadfully.  His yelling soon
attracted other street dogs, who came up to him and inquired how
he had enjoyed his supper.  He replied, "Why, to tell you the
truth, I drank so much wine that I remember nothing.  I do not
know how I got out of the house."  
 
The Travelers and the Plane-Tree 
 
TWO TRAVELERS, worn out by the heat of the summer's sun, laid
themselves down at noon under the widespreading branches of a
Plane-Tree.  As they rested under its shade, one of the Travelers
said to the other, "What a singularly useless tree is the Plane!
It bears no fruit, and is not of the least service to man."  The
Plane-Tree, interrupting him, said, "You ungrateful fellows! Do
you, while receiving benefits from me and resting under my shade,
dare to describe me as useless, and unprofitable?'  
 
Some men underrate their best blessings.  
 

The Hares and the Frogs 
 
THE HARES, oppressed by their own exceeding timidity and weary of
the perpetual alarm to which they were exposed, with one accord
determined to put an end to themselves and their troubles by
jumping from a lofty precipice into a deep lake below.  As they
scampered off in large numbers to carry out their resolve, the
Frogs lying on the banks of the lake heard the noise of their
feet and rushed helter-skelter to the deep water for safety.  On
seeing the rapid disappearance of the Frogs, one of the Hares
cried out to his companions:  "Stay, my friends, do not do as you
intended; for you now see that there are creatures who are still
more timid than ourselves."  
 

The Lion, Jupiter, and the Elephant 
 
THE LION wearied Jupiter with his frequent complaints.  "It is
true, O Jupiter!"  he said, "that I am gigantic in strength,
handsome in shape, and powerful in attack.  I have jaws well
provided with teeth, and feet furnished with claws, and I lord it
over all the beasts of the forest, and what a disgrace it is,
that being such as I am, I should be frightened by the crowing of
a cock."  Jupiter replied, "Why do you blame me without a cause? I
have given you all the attributes which I possess myself, and
your courage never fails you except in this one instance."  On
hearing this the Lion groaned and lamented very much and,
reproaching himself with his cowardice, wished that he might die. 
As these thoughts passed through his mind, he met an Elephant and
came close to hold a conversation with him.  After a time he
observed that the Elephant shook his ears very often, and he
inquired what was the matter and why his ears moved with such a
tremor every now and then.  Just at that moment a Gnat settled on
the head of the Elephant, and he replied, "Do you see that little
buzzing insect? If it enters my ear, my fate is sealed.  I should
die presently."  The Lion said, "Well, since so huge a beast is
afraid of a tiny gnat, I will no more complain, nor wish myself
dead.  I find myself, even as I am, better off than the
Elephant."  
 
The Lamb and the Wolf 
 
A WOLF pursued a Lamb, which fled for refuge to a certain Temple. 
The Wolf called out to him and said, "The Priest will slay you in
sacrifice, if he should catch you."  On which the Lamb replied,
"It would be better for me to be sacrificed in the Temple than to
be eaten by you."  
 

The Rich Man and the Tanner 
 
A RICH MAN lived near a Tanner, and not being able to bear the
unpleasant smell of the tan-yard, he pressed his neighbor to go
away.  The Tanner put off his departure from time to time, saying
that he would leave soon.  But as he still continued to stay, as
time went on, the rich man became accustomed to the smell, and
feeling no manner of inconvenience, made no further complaints.  
 

The Shipwrecked Man and the Sea 
 
A SHIPWRECKED MAN, having been cast upon a certain shore, slept
after his buffetings with the deep.  After a while he awoke, and
looking upon the Sea, loaded it with reproaches.  He argued that
it enticed men with the calmness of its looks, but when it had
induced them to plow its waters, it grew rough and destroyed
them.  The Sea, assuming the form of a woman, replied to him:
"Blame not me, my good sir, but the winds, for I am by my own
nature as calm and firm even as this earth; but the winds
suddenly falling on me create these waves, and lash me into
fury."  
 

The Mules and the Robbers 
 
TWO MULES well-laden with packs were trudging along.  One carried
panniers filled with money, the other sacks weighted with grain. 
The Mule carrying the treasure walked with head erect, as if
conscious of the value of his burden, and tossed up and down the
clear-toned bells fastened to his neck.  His companion followed
with quiet and easy step.  All of a sudden Robbers rushed upon
them from their hiding-places, and in the scuffle with their
owners, wounded with a sword the Mule carrying the treasure,
which they greedily seized while taking no notice of the grain. 
The Mule which had been robbed and wounded bewailed his
misfortunes.  The other replied, "I am indeed glad that I was
thought so little of, for I have lost nothing, nor am I hurt with
any wound."  
 

The Viper and the File 
 
A LION, entering the workshop of a smith, sought from the tools
the means of satisfying his hunger.  He more particularly
addressed himself to a File, and asked of him the favor of a
meal.  The File replied, "You must indeed be a simple-minded
fellow if you expect to get anything from me, who am accustomed
to take from everyone, and never to give anything in return."  
 

The Lion and the Shepherd 
 
A LION, roaming through a forest, trod upon a thorn.  Soon
afterward he came up to a Shepherd and fawned upon him, wagging
his tail as if to say, "I am a suppliant, and seek your aid."  The
Shepherd boldly examined the beast, discovered the thorn, and
placing his paw upon his lap, pulled it out; thus relieved of his
pain, the Lion returned into the forest.  Some time after, the
Shepherd, being imprisoned on a false accusation, was condemned
"to be cast to the Lions" as the punishment for his imputed
crime.  But when the Lion was released from his cage, he
recognized the Shepherd as the man who healed him, and instead of
attacking him, approached and placed his foot upon his lap.  The
King, as soon as he heard the tale, ordered the Lion to be set
free again in the forest, and the Shepherd to be pardoned and
restored to his friends.  
 

The Camel and Jupiter 
 
THE CAMEL, when he saw the Bull adorned with horns, envied him
and wished that he himself could obtain the same honors.  He went
to Jupiter, and besought him to give him horns.  Jupiter, vexed
at his request because he was not satisfied with his size and
strength of body, and desired yet more, not only refused to give
him horns, but even deprived him of a portion of his ears.  
 

The Panther and the Shepherds 
 
A PANTHER, by some mischance, fell into a pit.  The Shepherds
discovered him, and some threw sticks at him and pelted him with
stones, while others, moved with compassion towards one about to
die even though no one should hurt him, threw in some food to
prolong his life.  At night they returned home, not dreaming of
any danger, but supposing that on the morrow they would find him
dead.  The Panther, however, when he had recruited his feeble
strength, freed himself with a sudden bound from the pit, and
hastened to his den with rapid steps.  After a few days he came
forth and slaughtered the cattle, and, killing the Shepherds who
had attacked him, raged with angry fury.  Then they who had
spared his life, fearing for their safety, surrendered to him
their flocks and begged only for their lives.  To them the
Panther made this reply:  "I remember alike those who sought my
life with stones, and those who gave me food    
aside, therefore, your fears.  I return as an enemy only to those
who injured me."  
 

The Ass and the Charger 
 
AN ASS congratulated a Horse on being so ungrudgingly and
carefully provided for, while he himself had scarcely enough to
eat and not even that without hard work.  But when war broke out,
a heavily armed soldier mounted the Horse, and riding him to the
charge, rushed into the very midst of the enemy.  The Horse was
wounded and fell dead on the battlefield.  Then the Ass, seeing
all these things, changed his mind, and commiserated the Horse.  
 

The Eagle and His Captor 
 
AN EAGLE was once captured by a man, who immediately clipped his
wings and put him into his poultry-yard with the other birds, at
which treatment the Eagle was weighed down with grief.  Later,
another neighbor purchased him and allowed his feathers to grow
again.  The Eagle took flight, and pouncing upon a hare, brought
it at once as an offering to his benefactor.  A Fox, seeing this,
exclaimed, "Do not cultivate the favor of this man, but of your
former owner, lest he should again hunt for you and deprive you a
second time of your wings."  
 

The Bald Man and the Fly 
 
A FLY bit the bare head of a Bald Man who, endeavoring to destroy
it, gave himself a heavy slap.  Escaping, the Fly said mockingly,
"You who have wished to revenge, even with death, the Prick of a
tiny insect, see what you have done to yourself to add insult to
injury?'  The Bald Man replied, "I can easily make peace with
myself, because I know there was no intention to hurt.  But you,
an ill-favored and contemptible insect who delights in sucking
human blood, I wish that I could have killed you even if I had
incurred a heavier penalty."  
 

The Olive-Tree and the Fig-Tree 
 
THE OLIVE-TREE ridiculed the Fig-Tree because, while she was
green all the year round, the Fig-Tree changed its leaves with
the seasons.  A shower of snow fell upon them, and, finding the
Olive full of foliage, it settled upon its branches and broke
them down with its weight, at once despoiling it of its beauty
and killing the tree.  But finding the Fig-Tree denuded of
leaves, the snow fell through to the ground, and did not injure
it at all.  
 

The Eagle and the Kite 
 
AN EAGLE, overwhelmed with sorrow, sat upon the branches of a
tree in company with a Kite.  "Why," said the Kite, "do I see you
with such a rueful look?'  "I seek," she replied, "a mate suitable
for me, and am not able to find one."  "Take me," returned the
Kite, "I am much stronger than you are."  "Why, are you able to
secure the means of living by your plunder?'  "Well, I have often
caught and carried away an ostrich in my talons."  The Eagle,
persuaded by these words, accepted him as her mate.  Shortly
after the nuptials, the Eagle said, "Fly off and bring me back
the ostrich you promised me."  The Kite, soaring aloft into the
air, brought back the shabbiest possible mouse, stinking from the
length of time it had lain about the fields.  "Is this," said the
Eagle, "the faithful fulfillment of your promise to me?'  The Kite
replied, "That I might attain your royal hand, there is nothing
that I would not have promised, however much I knew that I must
fail in the performance."  
 

The Ass and His Driver 
 
AN ASS, being driven along a high road, suddenly started off and
bolted to the brink of a deep precipice.  While he was in the act
of throwing himself over, his owner seized him by the tail,
endeavoring to pull him back.  When the Ass persisted in his
effort, the man let him go and said, "Conquer, but conquer to
your cost."  
 

The Thrush and the Fowler 
 
A THRUSH was feeding on a myrtle-tree and did not move from it
because its berries were so delicious.  A Fowler observed her
staying so long in one spot, and having well bird-limed his
reeds, caught her.  The Thrush, being at the point of death,
exclaimed, "O foolish creature that I am! For the sake of a
little pleasant food I have deprived myself of my life."  
 

The Rose and the Amaranth 
 
AN AMARANTH planted in a garden near a Rose-Tree, thus addressed
it:  "What a lovely flower is the Rose, a favorite alike with Gods
and with men.  I envy you your beauty and your perfume."  The Rose
replied, "I indeed, dear Amaranth, flourish but for a brief
season! If no cruel hand pluck me from my stem, yet I must perish
by an early doom.  But thou art immortal and dost never fade, but
bloomest for ever in renewed youth."  
 

The Frogs' Complaint Against the Sun 
 
ONCE UPON A TIME, when the Sun announced his intention to take a
wife, the Frogs lifted up their voices in clamor to the sky. 
Jupiter, disturbed by the noise of their croaking, inquired the
cause of their complaint.  One of them said, "The Sun, now while
he is single, parches up the marsh, and compels us to die
miserably in our arid homes.  What will be our future condition
if he should beget other suns?'  
 

LIFE OF AESOP 
 
THE LIFE and History of Aesop is involved, like that of Homer,
the most famous of Greek poets, in much obscurity.  Sardis, the
capital of Lydia; Samos, a Greek island; Mesembria, an ancient
colony in Thrace; and Cotiaeum, the chief city of a province of
Phrygia, contend for the distinction of being the birthplace of
Aesop.  Although the honor thus claimed cannot be definitely
assigned to any one of these places, yet there are a few
incidents now generally accepted by scholars as established
facts, relating to the birth, life, and death of Aesop.  He is,
by an almost universal consent, allowed to have been born about
the year 620 B.C., and to have been by birth a slave.  He was
owned by two masters in succession, both inhabitants of Samos,
Xanthus and Jadmon, the latter of whom gave him his liberty as a
reward for his learning and wit.  One of the privileges of a
freedman in the ancient republics of Greece, was the permission
to take an active interest in public affairs; and Aesop, like the
philosophers Phaedo, Menippus, and Epictetus, in later times,
raised himself from the indignity of a servile condition to a
position of high renown.  In his desire alike to instruct and to
be instructed, he travelled through many countries, and among
others came to Sardis, the capital of the famous king of Lydia,
the great patron, in that day, of learning and of learned men. 
He met at the court of Croesus with Solon, Thales, and other
sages, and is related so to have pleased his royal master, by the
part he took in the conversations held with these philosophers,
that he applied to him an expression which has since passed into
a proverb, "The Phrygian has spoken better than all."  
 
On the invitation of Croesus he fixed his residence at Sardis,
and was employed by that monarch in various difficult and
delicate affairs of State.  In his discharge of these commissions
he visited the different petty republics of Greece.  At one time
he is found in Corinth, and at another in Athens, endeavouring,
by the narration of some of his wise fables, to reconcile the
inhabitants of those cities to the administration of their
respective rulers Periander and Pisistratus.  One of these
ambassadorial missions, undertaken at the command of Croesus, was
the occasion of his death.  Having been sent to Delphi with a
large sum of gold for distribution among the citizens, he was so
provoked at their covetousness that he refused to divide the
money, and sent it back to his master.  The Delphians, enraged at
this treatment, accused him of impiety, and, in spite of his
sacred character as ambassador, executed him as a public
criminal.  This cruel death of Aesop was not unavenged.  The
citizens of Delphi were visited with a series of calamities,
until they made a public reparation of their crime; and, "The
blood of Aesop" became a well- 
known adage, bearing witness to the truth that deeds of wrong
would not pass unpunished.  Neither did the great fabulist lack
posthumous honors; for a statue was erected to his memory at
Athens, the work of Lysippus, one of the most famous of Greek
sculptors.  Phaedrus thus immortalizes the event:

Aesopo ingentem statuam posuere Attici,
Servumque collocarunt aeterna in basi:  
Patere honoris scirent ut cuncti viam; 
Nec generi tribui sed virtuti gloriam.
 
These few facts are all that can be relied on with any degree of
certainty, in reference to the birth, life, and death of Aesop. 
They were first brought to light, after a patient search and
diligent perusal of ancient authors, by a Frenchman, M. Claude
Gaspard Bachet de Mezeriac, who declined the honor of being
tutor to Louis XIII of France, from his desire to devote himself
exclusively to literature.  He published his Life of Aesop, Anno
Domini 1632.  The later investigations of a host of English and
German scholars have added very little to the facts given by M.
Mezeriac.  The substantial truth of his statements has been
confirmed by later criticism and inquiry.  It remains to state,
that prior to this publication of M. Mezeriac, the life of Aesop
was from the pen of Maximus Planudes, a monk of Constantinople,
who was sent on an embassy to Venice by the Byzantine Emperor
Andronicus the elder, and who wrote in the early part of the
fourteenth century.  His life was prefixed to all the early
editions of these fables, and was republished as late as 1727 by
Archdeacon Croxall as the introduction to his edition of Aesop. 
This life by Planudes contains, however, so small an amount of
truth, and is so full of absurd pictures of the grotesque
deformity of Aesop, of wondrous apocryphal stories, of lying
legends, and gross anachronisms, that it is now universally
condemned as false, puerile, and unauthentic.  l It is given up
in the present day, by general consent, as unworthy of the
slightest credit.  
G.F.T.  
 
1 M. Bayle thus characterises this Life of Aesop by Planudes,
"Tous les habiles gens conviennent que c'est un roman, et que les
absurdites grossieres qui l'on y trouve le rendent indigne de
toute."

*********Preface********
PREFACE 
 
THE TALE, the Parable, and the Fable are all common and popular
modes of conveying instruction.  Each is distinguished by its own
special characteristics.  The Tale consists simply in the
narration of a story either founded on facts, or created solely
by the imagination, and not necessarily associated with the
teaching of any moral lesson.  The Parable is the designed use of
language purposely intended to convey a hidden and secret
meaning other than that contained in the words themselves; and
which may or may not bear a special reference to the hearer, or
reader.  The Fable partly agrees with, and partly differs from
both of these.  It will contain, like the Tale, a short but real
narrative; it will seek, like the Parable, to convey a hidden
meaning, and that not so much by the use of language, as by the
skilful introduction of fictitious characters; and yet unlike to
either Tale or Parable, it will ever keep in view, as its high
prerogative, and inseparable attribute, the great purpose of
instruction, and will necessarily seek to inculcate some moral
maxim, social duty, or political truth.  The true Fable, if it
rise to its high requirements, ever aims at one great end and
purpose representation of human motive, and the improvement of
human conduct, and yet it so conceals its design under the
disguise of fictitious characters, by clothing with speech the
animals of the field, the birds of the air, the trees of the
wood, or the beasts of the forest, that the reader shall receive
advice without perceiving the presence of the adviser.  Thus the
superiority of the counsellor, which often renders counsel
unpalatable, is kept out of view, and the lesson comes with the
greater acceptance when the reader is led, unconsciously to
himself, to have his sympathies enlisted in behalf of what is
pure, honorable, and praiseworthy, and to have his indignation
excited against what is low, ignoble, and unworthy.  The true
fabulist, therefore, discharges a most important function.  He is
neither a narrator, nor an allegorist.  He is a great teacher, a
corrector of morals, a censor of vice, and a commender of virtue. 
In this consists the superiority of the Fable over the Tale or
the Parable.  The fabulist is to create a laugh, but yet, under a
merry guise, to convey instruction.  Phaedrus, the great imitator
of Aesop, plainly indicates this double purpose to be the true
office of the writer of fables.  
 
Duplex libelli dos est:  quod risum movet, 
Et quod prudenti vitam consilio monet.  
 
The continual observance of this twofold aim creates the charm,
and accounts for the universal favor, of the fables of Aesop. 
"The fable," says Professor K. O. Mueller, "originated in Greece
in an intentional travestie of human affairs.  The 'ainos,' as
its name denotes, is an admonition, or rather a reproof veiled,
either from fear of an excess of frankness, or from a love of fun
and jest, beneath the fiction of an occurrence happening among
beasts; and wherever we have any ancient and authentic account of
the Aesopian fables, we find it to be the same."  l 
 
The construction of a fable involves a minute attention to (1)
the narration itself; (2) the deduction of the moral; and (3) a
careful maintenance of the individual characteristics of the
fictitious personages introduced into it.  The narration should
relate to one simple action, consistent with itself, and neither
be overladen with a multiplicity of details, nor distracted by a
variety of circumstances.  The moral or lesson should be so
plain, and so intimately interwoven with, and so necessarily
dependent on, the narration, that every reader should be
compelled to give to it the same undeniable interpretation.  The
introduction of the animals or fictitious characters should be
marked with an unexceptionable care and attention to their
natural attributes, and to the qualities attributed to them by
universal popular consent.  The Fox should be always cunning, the
Hare timid, the Lion bold, the Wolf cruel, the Bull strong, the
Horse proud, and the Ass patient.  Many of these fables are
characterized by the strictest observance of these rules.  They
are occupied with one short narrative, from which the moral
naturally flows, and with which it is intimately associated. 
"'Tis the simple manner," says Dodsley, 2 "in which the morals of
Aesop are interwoven with his fables that distinguishes him, and
gives him the preference over all other mythologists.  His
'Mountain delivered of a Mouse,' produces the moral of his fable
in ridicule of pompous pretenders; and his Crow, when she drops
her cheese, lets fall, as it were by accident, the strongest
admonition against the power of flattery.  There is no need of a
separate sentence to explain it; no possibility of impressing it
deeper, by that load we too often see of accumulated
reflections."  3 An equal amount of praise is due for the
consistency with which the characters of the animals,
fictitiously introduced, are marked.  While they are made to
depict the motives and passions of men, they retain, in an
eminent degree, their own special features of craft or counsel,
of cowardice or courage, of generosity or rapacity.  
 
These terms of praise, it must be confessed, cannot be bestowed
on all the fables in this collection.  Many of them lack that
unity of design, that close connection of the moral with the
narrative, that wise choice in the introduction of the animals,
which constitute the charm and excellency of true Aesopian fable. 
This inferiority of some to others is sufficiently accounted for
in the history of the origin and descent of these fables.  The
great bulk of them are not the immediate work of Aesop.  Many are
obtained from ancient authors prior to the time in which he
lived.  Thus, the fable of the "Hawk and the Nightingale" is
related by Hesiod; 4 the "Eagle wounded by an Arrow, winged with
its own Feathers," by Aeschylus; 5 the "Fox avenging his wrongs
on the Eagle," by Archilochus.  6 Many of them again are of later
origin, and are to be traced to the monks of the middle ages:  and
yet this collection, though thus made up of fables both earlier
and later than the era of Aesop, rightfully bears his name,
because he composed so large a number (all framed in the same
mould, and conformed to the same fashion, and stamped with the
same lineaments, image, and superscription) as to secure to
himself the right to be considered the father of Greek fables,
and the founder of this class of writing, which has ever since
borne his name, and has secured for him, through all succeeding
ages, the position of the first of moralists.7 
 
The fables were in the first instance only narrated by Aesop, and
for a long time were handed down by the uncertain channel of oral
tradition.  Socrates is mentioned by Plato 8 as having employed
his time while in prison, awaiting the return of the sacred ship
from Delphos which was to be the signal of his death, in turning
some of these fables into verse, but he thus versified only such
as he remembered.  Demetrius Phalereus, a philosopher at Athens
about 300 B.C., is said to have made the first collection of
these fables.  Phaedrus, a slave by birth or by subsequent
misfortunes, and admitted by Augustus to the honors of a
freedman, imitated many of these fables in Latin iambics about
the commencement of the Christian era.  Aphthonius, a rhetorician
of Antioch, A.D. 315, wrote a treatise on, and converted into
Latin prose, some of these fables.  This translation is the more
worthy of notice, as it illustrates a custom of common use, both
in these and in later times.  The rhetoricians and philosophers
were accustomed to give the Fables of Aesop as an exercise to
their scholars, not only inviting them to discuss the moral of
the tale, but also to practice and to perfect themselves thereby
in style and rules of grammar, by making for themselves new and
various versions of the fables.  Ausonius, 9 the friend of the
Emperor Valentinian, and the latest poet of eminence in the
Western Empire, has handed down some of these fables in verse,
which Julianus Titianus, a contemporary writer of no great name,
translated into prose.  Avienus, also a contemporary of Ausonius,
put some of these fables into Latin elegiacs, which are given by
Nevelet (in a book we shall refer to hereafter), and are
occasionally incorporated with the editions of Phaedrus.  
 
Seven centuries elapsed before the next notice is found of the
Fables of Aesop.  During this long period these fables seem to
have suffered an eclipse, to have disappeared and to have been
forgotten; and it is at the commencement of the fourteenth
century, when the Byzantine emperors were the great patrons of
learning, and amidst the splendors of an Asiatic court, that we
next find honors paid to the name and memory of Aesop.  Maximus
Planudes, a learned monk of Constantinople, made a collection of
about a hundred and fifty of these fables.  Little is known of
his history.  Planudes, however, was no mere recluse, shut up in
his monastery.  He took an active part in public affairs.  In
1327 A.D.  he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Venice by the
Emperor Andronicus the Elder.  This brought him into immediate
contact with the Western Patriarch, whose interests he henceforth
advocated with so much zeal as to bring on him suspicion and
persecution from the rulers of the Eastern Church.  Planudes has
been exposed to a two-fold accusation.  He is charged on the one
hand with having had before him a copy of Babrias (to whom we
shall have occasion to refer at greater length in the end of this
Preface), and to have had the bad taste "to transpose," or to
turn his poetical version into prose:  and he is asserted, on the
other hand, never to have seen the Fables of Aesop at all, but to
have himself invented and made the fables which he palmed off
under the name of the famous Greek fabulist.  The truth lies
between these two extremes.  Planudes may have invented some few
fables, or have inserted some that were current in his day; but
there is an abundance of unanswerable internal evidence to prove
that he had an acquaintance with the veritable fables of Aesop,
although the versions he had access to were probably corrupt, as
contained in the various translations and disquisitional
exercises of the rhetoricians and philosophers.  His collection
is interesting and important, not only as the parent source or
foundation of the earlier printed versions of Aesop, but as the
direct channel of attracting to these fables the attention of the
learned.  
 
The eventual re-introduction, however, of these Fables of Aesop
to their high place in the general literature of Christendom, is
to be looked for in the West rather than in the East.  The
calamities gradually thickening round the Eastern Empire, and the
fall of Constantinople, 1453 A.D.  combined with other events to
promote the rapid restoration of learning in Italy; and with that
recovery of learning the revival of an interest in the Fables of
Aesop is closely identified.  These fables, indeed, were among
the first writings of an earlier antiquity that attracted
attention.  They took their place beside the Holy Scriptures and
the ancient classic authors, in the minds of the great students
of that day.  Lorenzo Valla, one of the most famous promoters of
Italian learning, not only translated into Latin the Iliad of
Homer and the Histories of Herodotus and Thucydides, but also the
Fables of Aesop.  
 
These fables, again, were among the books brought into an
extended circulation by the agency of the printing press.  Bonus
Accursius, as early as 1475-1480, printed the collection of these
fables, made by Planudes, which, within five years afterwards,
Caxton translated into English, and printed at his press in West-
minster Abbey, 1485.  10 It must be mentioned also that the
learning of this age has left permanent traces of its influence
on these fables, ll by causing the interpolation with them of
some of those amusing stories which were so frequently introduced
into the public discourses of the great preachers of those days,
and of which specimens are yet to be found in the extant sermons
of Jean Raulin, Meffreth, and Gabriel Barlette.   12 The
publication of this era which most probably has influenced these
fables, is the "Liber Facetiarum," l3 a book consisting of a
hundred jests and stories, by the celebrated Poggio Bracciolini,
published A.D.  1471, from which the two fables of the "Miller,
his Son, and the Ass," and the "Fox and the Woodcutter," are
undoubtedly selected.  
 
The knowledge of these fables rapidly spread from Italy into
Germany, and their popularity was increased by the favor and
sanction given to them by the great fathers of the Reformation,
who frequently used them as vehicles for satire and protest
against the tricks and abuses of the Romish ecclesiastics.  The
zealous and renowned Camerarius, who took an active part in the
preparation of the Confession of Augsburgh, found time, amidst
his numerous avocations, to prepare a version for the students in
the university of Tubingen, in which he was a professor.  Martin
Luther translated twenty of these fables, and was urged by
Melancthon to complete the whole; while Gottfried Arnold, the
celebrated Lutheran theologian, and librarian to Frederick I,
king of Prussia, mentions that the great Reformer valued the
Fables of Aesop next after the Holy Scriptures.  In 1546 A.D. 
the second printed edition of the collection of the Fables made
by Planudes, was issued from the printing-press of Robert
Stephens, in which were inserted some additional fables from a
MS. in the Bibliotheque du Roy at Paris.  
 
The greatest advance, however, towards a re-introduction of the
Fables of Aesop to a place in the literature of the world, was
made in the early part of the seventeenth century.  In the year
1610, a learned Swiss, Isaac Nicholas Nevelet, sent forth the
third printed edition of these fables, in a work entitled
"Mythologia Aesopica."  This was a noble effort to do honor to
the great fabulist, and was the most perfect collection of
Aesopian fables ever yet published.  It consisted, in addition to
the collection of fables given by Planudes and reprinted in the
various earlier editions, of one hundred and thirty-six new
fables (never before published) from MSS.  in the Library of the
Vatican, of forty fables attributed to Aphthonius, and of
forty-three from Babrias.  It also contained the Latin versions
of the same fables by Phaedrus, Avienus, and other authors.  This
volume of Nevelet forms a complete "Corpus Fabularum
Aesopicarum;" and to his labors Aesop owes his restoration to
universal favor as one of the wise moralists and great teachers
of mankind.  During the interval of three centuries which has
elapsed since the publication of this volume of Nevelet's, no
book, with the exception of the Holy Scriptures, has had a wider
circulation than Aesop's Fables.  They have been translated into
the greater number of the languages both of Europe and of the
East, and have been read, and will be read, for generations,
alike by Jew, Heathen, Mohammedan, and Christian.  They are, at
the present time, not only engrafted into the literature of the
civilized world, but are familiar as household words in the
common intercourse and daily conversation of the inhabitants of
all countries.  
 
This collection of Nevelet's is the great culminating point in
the history of the revival of the fame and reputation of Aesopian
Fables.  It is remarkable, also, as containing in its preface the
germ of an idea, which has been since proved to have been correct
by a strange chain of circumstances.  Nevelet intimates an
opinion, that a writer named Babrias would be found to be the
veritable author of the existing form of Aesopian Fables.  This
intimation has since given rise to a series of inquiries, the
knowledge of which is necessary, in the present day, to a full
understanding of the true position of Aesop in connection with
the writings that bear his name.  
 
The history of Babrias is so strange and interesting, that it
might not unfitly be enumerated among the curiosities of
literature.  He is generally supposed to have been a Greek of
Asia Minor, of one of the Ionic Colonies, but the exact period in
which he lived and wrote is yet unsettled.  He is placed, by one
critic, l4 as far back as the institution of the Achaian League,
B.C.  250; by another as late as the Emperor Severus, who died
A.D.  235; while others make him a contemporary with Phaedrus in
the time of Augustus.  At whatever time he wrote his version of
Aesop, by some strange accident it seems to have entirely
disappeared, and to have been lost sight of.  His name is
mentioned by Avienus; by Suidas, a celebrated critic, at the
close of the eleventh century, who gives in his lexicon several
isolated verses of his version of the fables; and by John
Tzetzes, a grammarian and poet of Constantinople, who lived
during the latter half of the twelfth century.  Nevelet, in the
preface to the volume which we have described, points out that
the Fables of Planudes could not be the work of Aesop, as they
contain a reference in two places to "Holy monks," and give a
verse from the Epistle of St.  James as an "Epimith" to one of
the fables, and suggests Babrias as their author.  Francis
Vavassor, 15 a learned French jesuit, entered at greater length
on this subject, and produced further proofs from internal
evidence, from the use of the word Piraeus in describing the
harbour of Athens, a name which was not given till two hundred
years after Aesop, and from the introduction of other modern
words, that many of these fables must have been at least
committed to writing posterior to the time of Aesop, and more
boldly suggests Babrias as their author or collector.  16 These
various references to Babrias induced Dr. Plichard Bentley, at
the close of the seventeenth century, to examine more minutely
the existing versions of Aesop's Fables, and he maintained that
many of them could, with a slight change of words, be resolved
into the Scazonic l7 iambics, in which Babrias is known to have
written:  and, with a greater freedom than the evidence then
justified, he put forth, in behalf of Babrias, a claim to the
exclusive authorship of these fables.  Such a seemingly
extravagant theory, thus roundly asserted, excited much
opposition.  Dr. Bentley l8 met with an able antagonist in a
member of the University of Oxford, the Hon.  Mr.  Charles Boyle,
19 afterwards Earl of Orrery.  Their letters and disputations on
this subject, enlivened on both sides with much wit and learning,
will ever bear a conspicuous place in the literary history of the
seventeenth century.  The arguments of Dr. Bentley were yet
further defended a few years later by Mr.  Thomas Tyrwhitt, a
well-read scholar, who gave up high civil distinctions that he
might devote himself the more unreservedly to literary pursuits. 
Mr.  Tyrwhitt published, A.D.  1776, a Dissertation on Babrias,
and a collection of his fables in choliambic meter found in a MS. 
in the Bodleian Library at Oxford.  Francesco de Furia, a learned
Italian, contributed further testimony to the correctness of the
supposition that Babrias had made a veritable collection of
fables by printing from a MS.  contained in the Vatican library
several fables never before published.  In the year 1844,
however, new and unexpected light was thrown upon this subject. 
A veritable copy of Babrias was found in a manner as singular as
were the MSS.  of Quinctilian's Institutes, and of Cicero's
Orations by Poggio in the monastery of St.  Gall A.D.  1416.  M.
Menoides, at the suggestion of M. Villemain, Minister of Public
Instruction to King Louis Philippe, had been entrusted with a
commission to search for ancient MSS., and in carrying out his
instructions he found a MS.  at the convent of St.  Laura, on
Mount Athos, which proved to be a copy of the long suspected and
wished-for choliambic version of Babrias.  This MS.  was found to
be divided into two books, the one containing a hundred and
twenty-five, and the other ninety-five fables.  This discovery
attracted very general attention, not only as confirming, in a
singular manner, the conjectures so boldly made by a long chain
of critics, but as bringing to light valuable literary treasures
tending to establish the reputation, and to confirm the antiquity
and authenticity of the great mass of Aesopian Fable.  The Fables
thus recovered were soon published.  They found a most worthy
editor in the late distinguished Sir George Cornewall Lewis, and
a translator equally qualified for his task, in the Reverend
James Davies, M.A., sometime a scholar of Lincoln College,
Oxford, and himself a relation of their English editor.  Thus,
after an eclipse of many centuries, Babrias shines out as the
earliest, and most reliable collector of veritable Aesopian
Fables.

3 Some of these fables had, no doubt, in the first instance, a
primary and private interpretation.  On the first occasion of
their being composed they were intended to refer to some passing
event, or to some individual acts of wrong-doing.  Thus, the
fables of the "Eagle and the Fox" and of the "Fox and Monkey' are
supposed to have been written by Archilochus, to avenge the
injuries done him by Lycambes.  So also the fables of the
"Swollen Fox" and of the "Frogs asking a King" were spoken by
Aesop for the immediate purpose of reconciling the inhabitants of
Samos and Athens to their respective rulers, Periander and
Pisistratus; while the fable of the "Horse and Stag" was composed
to caution the inhabitants of Himera against granting a bodyguard
to Phalaris.  In a similar manner, the fable from Phaedrus, the
"Marriage of the Sun," is supposed to have reference to the
contemplated union of Livia, the daughter of Drusus, with Sejanus
the favourite, and minister of Trajan.  These fables, however,
though thus originating in special events, and designed at first
to meet special circumstances, are so admirably constructed as to
be fraught with lessons of general utility, and of universal
application.

point d'apparence que les fables qui portent aujourd'hui son nom
soient les memes qu'il avait faites; elles viennent bien de lui
pour la plupart, quant a la matiere et la pensee; mais les
paroles sont d'un autre."  And again, "C'est donc a Hesiode, que
j'aimerais mieux attribuer la gloire de l'invention; mais sans
doute il laissa la chose tres imparfaite.  Esope la perfectionne
si heureusement, qu'on l'a regarde comme le vrai pere de cette

ll Fables may possibly have been not entirely unknown to the
mediaeval scholars.  There are two celebrated works which might
by some be classed amongst works of this description.  The one is
the "Speculum Sapientiae," attributed to St.  Cyril, Archbishop
of Jerusalem, but of a considerably later origin, and existing
only in Latin.  It is divided into four books, and consists of
long conversations conducted by fictitious characters under the
figures  the beasts of the field and forest, and aimed at the
rebuke of particular classes of men, the boastful, the proud, the
luxurious, the wrathful, &c.  None of the stories are precisely
those of Aesop, and none have the concinnity, terseness, and
unmistakable deduction of the lesson intended to be taught by
the fable, so conspicuous in the great Greek fabulist.  The exact
title of the book is this:  "Speculum Sapientiae, B.  Cyrilli
Episcopi:  alias quadripartitus apologeticus vocatus, in cujus
quidem proverbiis omnis et totius sapientiae speculum claret et
feliciter incipit."  The other is a larger work in two volumes,
published in the fourteenth century by Caesar Heisterbach, a
Cistercian monk, under the title of "Dialogus Miraculorum,"
reprinted in 1851.  This work consists of conversations in which
many stories are interwoven on all kinds of subjects.  It has no
correspondence with the pure Aesopian fable.

learned Frenchman, M. Bayle, who, in his admirable dictionary,

of his learned predecessors, Nevelet and Vavassor.

END. 


                                Alice in UNIX Land
    
    
    Alice was reading the message on her monitor and beginning to suspect
    that everything was not as it should be.  "Program too big to fit in
    memory," it read.

           "Curiouser and curiouser," she said, "All I did was load
    fourteen TSRs before starting my word processor.  With four megabytes,
    I wish I could use more than 640K."

           "At that moment, a small white consultant ( a very white
    consultant) ran across the room.  "Oh my coat and necktie," he said,
    "I'm going to be late for my appointment.  And at one fifty an hour,
    too."  Before Alice could say anything, he leaped into her monitor and
    disappeared behind her operating system.

           Alice thought that she had never seen anyone leap into a monitor
    before; and certainly not go clean through the operating system.  But
    then, she had been told that DOS was very shallow.  Without hesitating
    a moment, she leaped in after him.

           She found herself in a shiny corridor.  Not knowing what else to
    do, she began walking.  Turning a corner, she found herself facing two
    fat little men, each with an arm round the other's neck.  One had "POS"
    embroidered on his collar, and the "NEG".

           "I know," said Alice, "you two are a transistor."

           "Yes," said Positive.

           "Can you help me? asked Alice.

           "No," said Negative.

           "I'm looking for a white consultant." Alice pointed in the
    direction she had been walking.  "Did he go this way?" she asked.

           "No," said Negative.

           She pointed the other way.

           "Yes," said Positive.

           Soon Alice came upon a large brown table.  The Consultant was
    there, as was an apparently Mad Hacker, and several creatures that
    Alice did not recognize.  In one corner sat a Dormouse fast asleep.
    Over the table was a large sign that read "UNIX Conference."

           Everyone except the Dormouse was holding a paper cup, from which
    they were sampling what appeared to be custard.  "Wrong flavor," they
    all declared as they passed the cup the cup to the creature on their
    right and graciously took the one being offered on their left.  Alice
    watched them repeat this ritual three or four times before she
    approached and sat down.

           Immediately, a large toad leaped into her lap and looked at her
    as if it wanted to be loved.  "Grep," it exclaimed.

           "Don't mind him," explained the Mad Hacker.  "He's just looking
    for some string."

           "Nroff?" asked the Frog.

           The Mad Hacker handed Alice a cup of custard-like substance and
    a spoon.  "Here," he said, "what do you think of this?"

           "It looks lovely," said Alice, "very sweet." She tried a
    spoonful.  "Yuck!" she cried.  "It's awful.  What is it?"

           "Oh just another graphic interface for UNIX," answered the
    Hacker.

           Alice pointed to the sleeping Dormouse.  "Who's he?" she asked.

           "That's OS Too," explained the Hacker.  "We've pretty much given
    up on waking him.

           "Just than, a large, Blue Elephant sitting next to the Dormouse
    stood up.  "Ladies and gentlemen," he trumpeted pompously, "as the
    largest creature here, I feel impelled to state that we must take an
    Open Look at..."

           A young Job Sparrow on the other side of the table stood up
    angrily.  The Elephant noticed and changed his speech
    accordingly."...what our NextStep will be.

           "Half the creatures bowed in respect while the other half
    snickered quietly to themselves.  Just then, OS Too fell over in his
    sleep, crashing into the Elephant and taking him down with him.  No one
    seemed a bit surprised.

           "What we need," declared a Sun Bear as he lapped up custard with
    his long tongue," is a flavor that goes down like the Macintosh.

           "Suddenly, the White Consultant began jumping up and down as his
    face got red.  "No, no, no! he screamed.  "No one pays one fifty an
    hour to Macintosh consultants!"

           "Awk," said the Frog.

           "Users," explained the Sun Bear, "want an easy interface that
    they will not have to learn."

           "Users?" cried the Consultant in disbelief. "Users?! You mean
    secretaries, accountants, architects. Manual laborers!"

           "Well," responded the Sun Bear, "we've got to do something to
    make them want to switch to UNIX."

           "Do you think," said a Woodpecker who had been busy making a
    hole in the table, "that there might be a problem with the name `UNIX?'
    I mean, it does sort of suggest being less than a man."

           "Maybe we should try another name, " suggested the Job Sparrow,
    "like Brut, or Rambo."

           "Penix," suggested a Penguin.

           "Mount," said the Frog, "spawn."

           Alice slapped him. "Nice?" he asked.

           "But then again," suggested the Woodpecker, "what about the
    shrinkwrap issue?"

           Suddenly, everyone leaped up and started dashing about, waving
    their hands in the air and screaming.  Just as suddenly, they all sat
    down again.

    
           "Now that that's settled," said the Woodpecker, "let's go back
    to tasting flavors."

           Everyone at the table sampled a new cup of custard. "Wrong
    flavor," they all declared as they passed the cup to the creature on
    their right and took the one being offered on their left.

           Totally confused, Alice got up and left. After she had been
    walking away, she heard a familiar voice behind her.

           "Rem," is said, "edlin."

           Alice turned and saw the Frog. She smiled. "Those are queer
    sounding words," she said, "but at least I know what they mean."

           "Chkdsk," said the Frog.

Aliens Take Over Earth   
 

Two alien badasses landed in Kansas recently, their names were Quark
and Mquark. They were advance
scouts for their empire's invasion fleets.

Unfortunately they landed near a small town on an early sunday
morning. They got out od their
spacecraft slowly and looked at all the wheat fields around them.
Looking for someone to threaten,
coerce or harass, they saw the buildings of the town in the distance
and started walking...

Not having done any sort of target research before landing they
approached a newspaper box next to the
deserted street.

Quark assumed it was an earthling and walked up to it, pulling a gun
out of his belt holster as he
approached...

"Okay earthling, take us to your leader!" Quark said angrily. "If you
don't I'll blow your ass away with
my nasty ass ray gun!" He waved his gun in front of the poor newspaper
box.

Of course, the newspaper box just sat there.

Quark shot it with the ray gun and that sunday's edition blew into
more than a million specks of paper
dust.

Mquark shook his head in disgust and then started walking down the
street. Quark holstered his pistol
and followed him.

They came upon a coke machine.

"This must be an earthling." Mquark said. "See, it's humming
slightly." Quark just nodded.

Mquark pulled out his gun and walked up right in front of the machine.
"Okay earthling, we're here to
take over. So take us to your leader!"

The coke machine just sat there, it's power supply humming very
quietly.

Mquark grew a little irate. "Look asshole!" He yelled at the coke
machine. "Take us to your leader right
goddamned now or I'm gonna blow your shit away with my nasty ass ray
gun!" The coke machine just
sat there. Mquark pulled the trigger and the coke machine
disintegrated in a most satisfying explosion.

They decided to keep looking. Now almost to the edge of town Quark and
Mquark see a gas station, not
yet opened for business. Quark stops immediately, a look of suprise on
his face. Mquark ignores him and
walkes up to one of the gas pumps, pulling out his ray gun as he
approaches.

"Okay, " Mquark starts out. "This may be your planet's last chance!
Take me to your leader or I'm
gonna get violent."

"Wait a minute." Quark calles out.

"Oh shut up!" Mquark shoots back at him. "Can't you see that threats
are the only thing these earthlings
are gonna understand?" He turns back to the gas pump.

"Okay now. If you don't take me to your leader right now I'm gonna
blow your shit away with my nasty
ass ray gun!"

The gas pump just sat there.

Mquark shot the gas pump - the resulting explosion was quite
impressive. Mquark and Quark got blown
through the air - almost all the way back to their spaceship.

Quark got up first, and started to brush the soot and wheat off his
uniform, shaking his head slowly.
Mquark stayed on the ground for a moment, shaking his head to clear
it. Finally he looked up at Quark,
"How, did you know to be wary of that dude?"

Quark thought a moment before answering. "Man, I make it a rule -
never fuck with anybody that wraps
his dick around his waist twice and then sticks it in his ear."

I haven't lost my mind - It's backed up on tape somewhere...

1. A HIGHER INTELLIGENCE...
AT&T fired President John Walter after nine months, saying he lacked
"intellectual leadership." He received a $26 million severance package. 
Perhaps it's not Walter who's lacking intelligence.
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
2. WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM OUR FRIENDS!
Police in Oakland, California spent two hours attempting to subdue a gunman
who had barricaded himself inside his home. After firing ten tear gas
canisters, officers discovered that the man was standing beside them,
shouting "Please come out and give yourself up".
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
3. WHAT WAS PLAN B???
An Illinois man pretending to have a gun kidnapped a motorist and forced
him to drive to two different automated teller machines. The kidnapper then
proceeded to withdraw money from his own bank accounts.
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
4. THE GETAWAY!
A man walked into a Topeka, Kansas Kwik Stop, and asked for all the money
in the cash drawer. Apparently, the take was too small, so he tied up the
store clerk and worked the counter himself for three hours until police
showed up and grabbed him.
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
5. DID I SAY THAT???
Police in Los Angeles had good luck with a robbery suspect who just
couldn't control himself during a lineup. When detectives asked each man in
the lineup to repeat the words, "Give me all your money or I'll shoot," the
man shouted, "that's not what I said!"
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
6. ARE WE COMMUNICATING??
A man spoke frantically into the phone, "Her contractions are only two

7. NOT THE SHARPEST KNIFE IN THE DRAWER!!
In Modesto, CA, Steven Richard King was arrested for trying to hold up a
Bank of America branch without a weapon. King used a thumb and a finger to
simulate a gun, but unfortunately, he failed to keep his hand in his pocket
 (helllllloooooooooo!).

8.THE GRAND FINALE
Last summer, down on Lake Isabella, located in the high desert, an hour
east of Bakersfield, California, some folks, new to boating, were having a
problem. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't get their brand new
22-ft. Bayliner to perform. It wouldn't get on a plane at all, and it was
very sluggish in almost every maneuver, no matter how much power was
applied. After about an hour of trying to make it go, they putted over to a
nearby marina, thinking someone there could tell them what was wrong. 
A thorough topside check revealed everything in perfect working order. The
engine ran fine, the outdrive went up and down, the prop was the correct
size and pitch. So one of the marina guys jumped in the water to check
underneath. He came up choking on water, he was laughing so hard. Under the
boat, still strapped securely in place, was the trailer.

We know how you are and what you want, so at the sound of the
tone, please hang up.

Sherwood Forest.  Which dear do you want?

Hello, this is the Brown residence.  We're in the middle of a
family fight right now.  Leave your name and number at the beep
and whoever wins will call you right back.

My wife and I can't come to the phone right now, but if you'll
leave your name and number, we'll get back to you as soon as
we're finished.

Please leave your name, phone number, the time you called, and
your favorite color of underwear.  We'll get back to you if we
like the color.

Hello.  I'm home right now but cannot find the phone.  Please
leave a message and I will call you up as soon as I find it.

You have reached 843-4734.  Please hold while I process your
call.  (Pause.)  Our extremely sophisticated computer system
performed a trace on your number and was able to match it with
our list of important callers.  None of our staff is authorized
to speak with you except for Fred, who is not here right now.
Please leave your name phone number and a brief message at the
tone.  Thank you for calling and have a nice day.

I can't come to the phone now because I have amnesia and I feel
stupid talking to people I don't remember.  I'd appreciate it if
you could help me out by leaving my name and telling me
something about myself.  Thanks.

(Thug voice:)  Uh, hello, Mike and Brian aren't here right now.
They've been kidnapped!  So at the beep, leave your name, your
number, your message, and ten thousand dollars in a brown paper
bag.

(Italian Mafia-style voice:)  I can't come to the phone right
now.  Me and Guido are trying to stuff a body in the trunk.  I
think we're going to have to size it a little...  (Aside:)  HEY
GUIDO!  GET THE CHAINSAW!  Anyways, leave your name and a
message.  If I like it, you'll hear from me.  If not, you'll
hear from Guido!  (Laughter.)

Leave a message or I'll send 30,000 volts through your phone.
I am an electrical engineer.  I can do that.

My time is billed at $125 per hour.  Please begin your message
with your MasterCard or Visa number, card type, and date of
expiration.  I'll get back to you pending credit approval.

(A busy signal.)  -- Steven Wright

(Recorded directly from AT&T:)  We're sorry, but the number you
dialed is disconnected or no longer in service.

We're sorry.  You have reached an imaginary number.  Please
rotate your phone 90 degrees and try again.

You have reached the number you have dialed.  Please leave a
message after the beep.

Hello.  (Pause.)  Hello?  (Pause.)
Hello!  (Pause.)  No, it doesn't look as if I'm in right now.
Maybe you should leave a message or call me back later.

You have reached 555-6238.  Why?

From a Wisonsonite's point of view. . .
 
 The recent heat wave reminded me of the following that I had.  So if you are
 sick of the heat, just think, in 90 days it will be snowing (here, at any rate)

Last week I requested answering machine messages.  Here are the ones I've
gotten so far:

[I haven't posted names of originators because I'm lazy and editing this was 
already a pain.  Sorry.]

Ron

----------------------------------------------------
This is one of my old ones that got a lot of laughs:


<Phone Rings>

Noisy pick-up of phone

Uh...<wisperingly> Hello?

Hi, I 'm a burgular and I was just about to steal Troy's answering machine.
If you give me your name and number I'll..uh, I'll post it on the 'frige
where he'll see it.  Uh.. by the way, where did you say you live?

----------------------------------------------------
But right now I'm using "This is a boring answering machine message.
Leave a message anyway." because I'm sick of people ringing the phone
at 10am just so they can hear the clever messages I usually have, and
then hanging up without even leaving a "like your message" message.
Feh!

----------------------------------------------------
[Must have good Australian accent]
G'day mate.  Can't come to the phone now because I'm a bit tied up with
this crocodile.  Just leave a message, and I'll get back to you.

----------------------------------------------------
This is the Literacy Self Test Hotline.  After the tone, leave your name and
number and recite a sentence using today's vocabulary word.  Today's word
is supercilious                                                 ...}

----------------------------------------------------
The President is not in his office at this time.  Please leave your name,
phone number, the name of the country you wish to invade, and the secret
password.

----------------------------------------------------
Kemosabe no in tipi now.  You leave'um message after little smoke signal,
and Kemosabe get back for pow-wow real fast.

----------------------------------------------------
Also, on the subject of answering machins, my favorite tape was:
"This is Jeff, you're not in now so I'll leave a message."
Really confused people.

----------------------------------------------------
A bubble in the space-time continuum has connected your line to a channeler
in the 23rd Century.  Any message you leave will be broadcast into the
future....

------------------------------------------------
Hello.  I can't come to the phone now because--HEY, GEORGE!  DON'T STAND
ON THAT--goddam.  ...because I've invited George and Barbara Bush over
<loud music cuts in>...BARBARA!  HEY!  DON'T FUCK WITH THAT!...over for
dinner.  After the tone...BARBARA, CALL YOUR DOG...MILLIE! DOWN GIRL!
...shit...Leave a message after the tone...HEY, FUCKHEAD...<beep>

------------------------------------------------
Hello.  Lindsey's not home now--this is his domestic droid speaking.
I'm not programmed to answer the phone, so just leave a message, and
Lindsey will get back to you as soon as possible.

------------------------------------------------
"Hi! You have reached 579-7599.  This is an answering machine.  This is the
Eighties.  You know what to do."

------------------------------------------------
My wife and I can't come to the phone right now, but if you'll leave
your name and number we'll get back to you as soon as we're finished.

------------------------------------------------
Ring, Ring:
The number you have xxx-xxxx (your number) has been changed, the
new number is xxx-xxxx (again, your number). CULATA!

"Hello, and welcome to Answering Machines of the Rich and Famous!  
(your name here) can't come to the phone right now, because he's
spending the week in his beautiful summer home on the French Riviera..."

------------------------------------------------
One day I had a borrowed Casio sampler toy and used it to create a
rather interesting one:

Hello. You have reached Tooooommmmmm Tom Tm! Tom and
MaMaMaMarMMMMaark's room. Tom is studying ssttuuddyyiinngg sssssssssssss
and MaMark isn'isn'isn'isn't here. isn't here. P-P-Pleas! leave a
messssssssage. Goodbye. 'bye! bye!bbyebybyyeyeyebbye  {byes repeating
at all different pitches}

------------------------------------------------
Last year my roommate had a machine but he hated to make the outgoing
message. Stage fright, I guess. So I usually made them. One that we
usually used during exam time was:

{background music: Billy Joel's _Pressure_ very loud}
Hello. You have reached Tom and Mark's room. We're a little busy now...
{ BJ screams PRESSURE!!! }
So, leave a message and we'll get back to you someday after (exam end
date)
{ BJ: ONE TWO THREE FOUR PRESSURE!!! followed by a very out-of-tune BEEP! }

------------------------------------------------
My favorite message that I ever had was the *real* message I recorded
off 1-800-CALL-SPY, the U.S. army snitching network. Try it, its a great
recording (call after 5 pm for the message).

[Give it try!  -pZ]

------------------------------------------------
<Ring>
In the background can be heard springs creaking and various moans.

<Husky, Soft female voice is best> Hi,... You've just reached {name} pleasure
palace. We're all busy as I'm sure you can tell but when we're done... we'll 
get back to you in whatever way we can. <Beep>

You wouldn't believe how much explaining my mother wanted on that one...

------------------------------------------------
    [b.g. music is frantic, violin oriented]
    "hello.  you have reached xxx-xxxx.  we are currently unable to answer
    because we are either chasing, or being chased by, bats.  please leave
    a message..." etc.

------------------------------------------------
    [the quiet, eerie vocal part of 'hello, earth' by kate bush]
    (after about 30 seconds): "hello.  you have reached xxx-xxxx.
    we can't come to the phone right now because we're at vespers.
    please leave a message..." etc. (30 more seconds of music before 
    the beep.)

------------------------------------------------
(Spoken in a granny voice)

"Way back inna winner of fifty-two, we didn' have fanshy gadjets like
no ansherin' machine.  You jusht had to call and call until shummbody
got home.  Now, shum people, dey shay dey don' like 'em, but I shay
it'll shave you a lotta trouble if you jusht leave a meshage.  Thanksh a
lot."

Must be spoken in a drawl.

------------------------------------------------
Well, this isn't strictly from an answering machine, but...
>From Calvin and Hobbes:

(phone rings)
(you answer)  Hello, this is <...> speaking.  I'd like a large pizza
with extra anchovies.
(other person)  What?
(you reply)  Oh, sorry, I must have a wrong number.
(hang up)

Make everyone's day a little more surreal.

------------------------------------------------
"I'm home right now . . . I'm just screening my calls.  So just start talking
and if you're someone I want to speak to I'll pick up the phone.  Otherwise,
well, what can I say?

------------------------------------------------
In Japan, the hand can be used like a knife.
[sound effect: Heeeeee-YAH!, smashing box of kleenex]
But this method doesn't work with a telephone call...
[sound effect: dial tone]
Introducing the all-new GINSU answering machine! It cuts, it chops, 
it slices, it dices your incoming calls!  How much would you pay?
Don't answer, because if you leave your name and number when you
hear the tone, we'll throw in a return phone call ABSOLUTELY FREE!

------------------------------------------------
"Hi, you have reached .... Please leave your name, phone number and a
message and if we like it we will return your call".

------------------------------------------------
However, the most effective one I have had so far can be used only one day
per year: "This is David.  I'm not using the phone over Yom Kippur, so please
leave a message or call back after the holiday."  No one wants to admit not
having realized it was Yom Kippur or not knowing I would pick one holiday from
the whole calendar on which to get observant, so everyone hangs up and leaves
me no bad news or requests for favors.

------------------------------------------------
"This is David.  Talk."

------------------------------------------------
"Hi.  This is David.  I've shut the ringers off on my phones and taken a
sedative.  As soon as I finish this recording I'm going to bed indefinitely.
When I wake up I'll play my messages.  Please leave one."

------------------------------------------------
[with a kazoo band playing "Thus Spake Zarathustra" in the background...]
"Thinking you were making an ordinary phone call, you have instead
reached..." [YA-DAAAAAAAAA!] "...the ANSWERING MACHINE!  Leave your name
and number, and we will get back to you as soon as we can."

------------------------------------------------
"Hello, this is Dr. Pangloss.  If this were the best of all possible worlds,
I could come to the phone right now, but I can't, so if you could leave your
name and number..."

------------------------------------------------
     "Hello?" <pause for a few seconds> "Sorry, he's not here right now,
but if you leave a message, he'll get back to you."

------------------------------------------------
(woman taped off a "phone sex" service)

WOMAN : (seductively) Hi.  I'm Linda.  You know, it can be really lonely
when you're a fashion model.  Sometimes I just have to ...

YOU : (interupting) Oh cmon, Linda, give me the damn phone..
(then ask for a message)

------------------------------------------------
Just after the earthquake a friend of mine put on his answering machine:

     "Hi, this is Jeff.  We can't get to the phone right now because we
were killed in the Earthquake.  Tragic, isn't it?  But, leave a
message anyway, someone is sure to get it eventually."  BEEP

My favorite post quake message:

    "Hi, we're not in cause we're out LOOTING!
     Leave a message and we'll call you back and tell you what we got."

------------------------------------------------
"Hello, I'm not hear right now.  In fact, I'm out getting a new parakeet.
 If you leave a message after the beep, I'll be sure to get back to you.
 Oh, and by the way, a word of advice; never try to clean a parakeet cage
 with a vacuum cleaner."

------------------------------------------------
Ring...click....(sound of loud music in background)...Hello? - just
a second while I turn the stereo off (sound of person running to
click off music, which gets quiet.  sound of person running back
to phone) OK, sorry about that, hi there, who's this...well hi!...
uh huh...yeah...well listen you're talking to a machine, so please
leave a message and I'll call you back.

(this ran for a while until a friend threatened to kill us after
she said she had a 2 minute conversation with the machine.)

------------------------------------------------
     I worked for a bit in the coastguard in Wales and I used to send weather
reports to other bases, using a sort of antique FAX machine. I would call
first on a special telephone and then send the data. They used to answer the 
phone with:
    " Epicentre of the Universe, God speaking."
    " Hartland home for lost whores."  (that was Hartland CG) 
    " Da, zis iz Ivan: do you have zee secret information, Boris?"
    " Pentagon command: transmit destruct sequence (pause) sequence correct:
        T minus one minute and counting"
     And then there was one phone we didn't use, with a number one off that of 
the local take-out.  With my, non-British, accent I had some great fun with 
that phone.
     "Starship Enterprise, Uhura here, can you hold please?  -- Captain, there 
is a transmission coming in on hailing frequency seven, do you want it on 
screen?" (silence...click)
     "Van
couver coastguard, may I help you."  British long distance rates are
phenomenonal and I had this poor dude sputtering with horror that he had 
managed to make a long distance call by dialing five digits.

------------------------------------------------
A friend was at a mutal friend's sister's house, and when she went out for
beer, he changed her answering machine message.  In a loud, deep, gravely,
horror-film voice he recorded, "HI, THIS IS KATHY, I'M NOT MYSELF RIGHT NOW.
IF YOU LEAVE YOUR NAME AND NUMBER, I'LL GET BACK TO YOU WHEN I'M FEELING
BETTER."

------------------------------------------------
    Hi this is <name>. I'm sorry I can't answer the phone right now.
    Leave a message and then wait by the phone until I call you back.

------------------------------------------------
In the background can be heard Gregorian Chant or some other church music
<In a soft voice> Good Day My child, you have reached {name} dial a confession.
At the tone if you will leave your name, number and short confession I will get
back to you with your pennance. Thank you and may God go with you. <Beep>

------------------------------------------------
"Steve has been captured by a flying saucer and can't come to the phone
right now, but if you leave your name, phone number, and a message I'll
have him call you back as soon as he gets away.  Read all about it in
next week's National Enquirer."

------------------------------------------------
"Steve is reassembling Elvis' brain and can't come to the phone right
now, but if you leave your name ...", etc.

------------------------------------------------
(Annoying flute music in background)
Good day, Jim.  Your contact, [insert name], is not available right now.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to leave your name, 
number, and a brief message at the tone.  This tape will self-destruct
in thirty seconds.
Good Luck, Jim.

------------------------------------------------
A friend of mine at school has this message, read by three people while
the STAR TREK theme plays in the background.
     1:  Room 17, the final frontier.
     2:  These are the messages of Chad's answering machine.  Its 2 semester
         mission:  to seek out your name and your telepohne number.
     3:  To boldly inform you to wait for the tone.

------------------------------------------------
    "Finally get an answering machine. Now how does this thing work? Hmmm.
Press record button, I did that, and the light should be on. I wonder why it's
not working right. Hmmmm, I wonder what this button does......"

------------------------------------------------
    "This is (#include phone.addr). We are not ... excuse me a moment,
please. Put your sister down. PUT YOUR SISTER DOWN! (sound of window breaking)
Great! What a mess. I'll have to get back to you later."

------------------------------------------------
"Hello.  I'm David's answering machine.  What are you?"

------------------------------------------------
Steve:  Hello.  Steve and Matt aren't here right now but if...
Matt:  Steve, what are you doing?
Steve:  I'm leaving a phone message since we aren't here.
Matt:  But you left the last one -- it's my turn.
Steve:  No, I'm sure it's my turn.
Matt:  No, you're incorrect.  It's definitely my turn.
Steve:  You fool.  I know it's ... wait ... Matt ... what are you doing
    with that frying pan?!?
  BONK [really loud thud]
Matt:  Steve is out right now, so please leave your name and number.

[imitating Mr. Rogers]

Can you leave your name and number when you hear the sound of the tone?
Sure...I knew you could." <BEEP>

[imitating Ensign Chekov]
"Oh, sair...it was *Khan*!  He made us say things...do things...he
kept us from answering the phone!  But Keptin was strong, and if you

he can!"  <BEEP>

------------------------------------------------
"You have reached the <city>,<state> Strategic Air Command Nuclear
Missle Storage Facility.  We are unable to come to the phone right
now.  At the tone, please leave you name, number and target or list of
targets and we'll launch as soon as we can.  And have a nice day."

------------------------------------------------
"We are unable to come to the phone right now.  At the tone, please
leave your name, number, and Master Card, Visa, or American Express
account number and we'll get back to, pending credit approval."

------------------------------------------------
 "Hello, this is Jim. Unfortunately I can't answer the phone right now
  because I've just come back from the Mirror Worlds and I'm still made 
  up of antimatter, so if I were to pick up the phone right now, the 
  resulting energy release would make Hiroshima look like a wet firecracker.
  So leave a message at the tone and I'll get back to you as soon as my
  component particles have been restored to their normal charges."

------------------------------------------------
 "Speak, worm!" <beep>
  Works best if done in a Darth Vader voice.

------------------------------------------------
 "You know what to do at the tone." <beep>

------------------------------------------------
 "Hello?" <beep>
  This confuses anyone who doesn't know you.

------------------------------------------------
 "Hello, I'm not here." <beep>
  A friend of mine used this one last summer. I always answered it with
  "Okay, that's all I wanted to know."

------------------------------------------------
   Hi!! You've reached Janet and Chris's room. We're not in right now.
If this is our parents, we're at the library studying. Yeah, yeah,
that's it, that's the ticket. If this is John (Chris's boyfriend), Chris
is out with the girls at the party. Yeah, that's it. If this is any one
else, we're at a party and you're not. Yeah, a party with the president.
Yeah and the .... pope. Yeah that's it. <beep>

------------------------------------------------
One voice:  I didn't expect an answering machine.

Another voice: 
           Nobody expects an answrering machine.
           Our chief use is to get your name. And phone number.
           Our two chief uses are to get your name and phone number. And
               message.  (damn)
           Our three uses are to get your name, phone number, and
               message.   And time you called.
           Oh, damn, we'll have to start over. No--no time for that, so
               just wait for the beep. 

------------------------------------------------
(in an Italian mafia-style tone:)
"Hello.  I can't come to the phone right now.  Me and Guido are trying to

    You've reached the residence of John and Tom.  We can't
    come to the phone right now, because we're cleaning the
    refrigerator.  Please leave your name and number, and
    we'll get back to you.
    [Theme from "Indiana Jones" continues until the beep.]

------------------------------------------------
Hi!  John's answering machine is broken.  This is his
    refrigerator.  Please speak very slowly, and I'll stick
    your message to myself with one of these magnets.

One of my favorites had this very exciting scary music, along with a
kitten crying in the background, and the voice goes:

The machine answering this message is connected to a 5000 volt power
supply, and a relay which is wired to this small kitten.  If you hang up
before you leave a message, it will complete the circuit and will fry
the kitty.  The choice is YOURS....   BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP

    How do you leave a message on this thing?  I can't understand
    the instructions.  Hello.  Testing 1 2 3.  I wonder what happens
    if I touch this... YOW!!
------------------------------------------------
    I can't come to the phone now, so if, well, actually, I CAN come
    to the phone now, I mean, like, I'm at the phone NOW, recording
    this message, but I'm doing this NOW, while you're listening to
    it LATER, except for you I guess it's NOW, like, when you're
    listening to it...  I mean, like, wait, gosh.  This is so
    confusing.
------------------------------------------------
    I can't come to the phone now, so...  hey -- that's a nice phone
    you have there.  Hey sugar, you call this number often?  I bet
    you have answering machines bothering you all the time...  yes
    indeedy.  Why don't you give me a call sometime and we can
    listen to some old recordings...  I might even play my beep for
    you...

------------------------------------------------
    Don't you do it!  Don't you dare!  I don't want to hear it!
    Don't you beep!  If you beep, I'll...  don't even think about
    it!...  Don't...!

------------------------------------------------
    After the tone, leave your name, number, and tell where you left
    the money.  I'll get back to you as soon as it's safe for you to

    As the drugs take hold, you feel you are losing your grip on
    reality.  You begin to hallucinate.  You see a telephone...  the
    telephone is next to an answering machine...  you hear a faint
    click and a light flashes on the answering machine...  you hear
    a beep...

------------------------------------------------
    You're growing tired.  Your eyelids are getting heavy.  You feel
    very sleepy now.  You are gradually losing your willpower and
    your ability to resist suggestions.  When you hear the tone you
    will feel helplessly compelled to leave your name, number, and a
    message.

------------------------------------------------
    No!  NO!  Not THAT!  Anything but that!  Not the beep!  No!
    Please!  Not the beep!  Anything but the beep!

    [For Shakespeare lovers only]
    So long as phones can ring and eyes can see,
    So leave a message, and I'll get back to thee.

    [VOICE 1]  Answer the phone, please, Hal.
    [VOICE 2]  I'm sorry, Dave, I can't do that.

    I can't come to the phone right now because I'm down in the
    basement printing up a fresh new batch of 20 dollar bills.  If
    you need any money, or if you just want to check out my

    need after the tone.  If you're from the Department of the
    Treasury, please ignore this message.

------------------------------------------------
    Thank you for calling the Confessional Hotline.  Father Durway's
    not here right now, but if you'll leave your name, number, and
    confession at the tone, he'll get back to you with absolution as
    soon as possible.  And remember, confession doesn't count unless
    you confess all of your sins in vivid, graphic detail!

    Andy Warhol said that one day everyone will be famous for 15
    minutes.  Well, your 15 minutes was last week, but since you
    weren't ready, we gave it to Vanna White.  Sorry.

------------------------------------------------
    C'mon...  you can do it...  just a little one.  That's the
    way...  just a little beep, just a little one.  C'mon...  good
    boy...  here we go...  like this -- beeeeep, just a little one,
    beeeeeeeeeep, c'mon...  There you go!

------------------------------------------------
    I can't come to the phone now because I have amnesia and I feel
    stupid talking to people I don't remember.  I'd appreciate it if
    you could help me out by leaving my name and telling me
    something about myself.  Thanks.

------------------------------------------------
    I can't come to the phone now because alien beings are eating my

BOTH: Pump (CLAP) you up

HANS: You will leave a message after the beep

FRANZ: If you don't leave a message, then you are Girlyman.

HANS: Ya, Girlyman.  And we don't talk to Girlyman, you know

FRANZ: So leave a message and we will call to..

BOTH: Pump (CLAP) you up

"Hello!  This is 1-800-PRESLEY -- Yes!  1-800-PRESLEY!

They say the King died 10 years ago, but we know he's still out there
somewhere.  So . . . leave your name and number and tell us where
*YOU* saw Elvis!"

------------------------------------------------
       "Hi, you've reached 1-900-CALL-BREN, my personal message line where
        you can talk to me, Bren.  I'll tell you all about how I'm suffering 
        in between sports seasons and about my part time hobby of being a 
        power forward for the Portland Trailblazers.  I'll tell my deepest 
        secrets, such as my desire to be kidnapped by short blonde sorority
        girls wearing short jean skirts, and you can decide whether or not
        I'm wearing pants.  Selected callers will get to talk to me live.
        Since you're not one of them, leave your own personal secret at the
        beep. "

------------------------------------------------
 In a vaguely phoneco-operator voice: "I'm sorry, you have reached an
imaginary number. Would you please rotate your telephone by ninety
degrees and try your call again."
  
   A few people even got the joke...

------------------------------------------------
"You have just dialed into the North American Air Defense Contract Center.
Stand by at the tone to give coordinates and destination of incoming bogey.
TNR Surveillance will scramble. If you do not respond, this unit will assume
incoming, non-important."

------------------------------------------------
"Sherwood forest, which dear do you want?"

"Lucifer speaking, who in the hall do you want?"

"Heaven, God speaking."

"Bridge, Kirk here."

 "City Morgue, you kill 'em, we chill 'em; You stab 'em, we slab 'em!"

------------------------------------------------
"Thank you for calling Soviet Embassy.  No KG... Er, no diplomats are
able to answer phone, so at sound of capitalist tone, leave name,
telephone number, and short description of secrets you wish to sell."

------------------------------------------------
"I've set up my answering machine so that when anyone calls, they
   here a busy signal."

------------------------------------------------
If you are a burgler, then we are probably at home but can't come
        to the phone right now
Otherwise, we probably aren't at home.

------------------------------------------------
The number you've dialed is purely imaginary, multiply by i and dial again!

------------------------------------------------
     This is you-know who.
     We are you-know-where.
     Leave your you-know-what you-know-when.

------------------------------------------------
    " I'm Morley Safer."
    "I'm Harry Reasoner."
    "I'm ........
    "And I'm" <the guy whose answering machine it was>
    " We're not home; leave a message."

      He had taped the audio of the beginning of 60 minutes; it sounded
    very funny.

------------------------------------------------
"Greetings.  You've reached Ghengis Kahn's Pornographic Films 
Unlimited.  Fabian, Pat, Rex and Mike are still conducting screen 
tests with potential leading ladies to star opposite the late John 
Holmes in our upcoming feature film "It's Not the Size That Counts but 
Whether or Not You're Alive to Use It."  If you're interested in a
screen test, or even if you're not, please leave us your name, age,
phone number, measurements, cup size, a brief summary of your work
experience, both off and on the screen, and a brief summary of your
favorite fantasy involving four men, a pair of handcuffs, and a tub of
Cool Whip.  Thank you for calling." 

------------------------------------------------
Another one I've done more than once is to slowly increase the pitch
and speed of my voice while recording the message to make it sound
like the machine is broken: 

(start, low pitch, slow)
"Hhhhheeelllllloooooo thheeeerrrrrrre evvvvveerrrryyyboooodyyyy....

(middle, normal)
..home of Veronica, Jaw-Chyi, Mark and Mike. Nobody's home...

(later, high pitch, fast)
..butifyou'dliketoleaveamessageafterthetonethen...

(end, incomprehensible chipmunk gibberish)
..kkfjdkeirucjkljfkldjrioutjkjfdskoreudjfkleqBEEP!"

------------------------------------------------
    This is not an answering machine -- this is a telepathic
    thought-recording device.  After the tone, think about your
    name, your reason for calling, and a number where I can reach
    you, and I'll think about returning your call.

------------------------------------------------
    "E'llo."
    "My name is Inigo Montonya."
    "You killed my father."
    "Leave your name and number, and prepare to die."  
    <beep>

------------------------------------------------
My favorite that I have heard as an answering machine message is also
from this movie.  My friend recorded the section that goes something
like:

    "I'm writing the definative work on pain, and I would like you
to tell me how the machine makes you feel.  Remember, be honest.  This
is for posterity."

------------------------------------------------
The message I currently have on my recorder is the output from my Amiga's
speech sythesizer.  It's set up as a dialog between two distict, but
recognizably artificial voices.  I thought it sort of mediocre myself, but
have gotten quite a number of amused comments about it.
-----
1> Hello, there are no real people here to answer the phone right now.

2> Yeah, nobody but us machines!

1> Right, just us machines, but don't hang up!  If you like, you can leave
   your name and telephone number...

2> ...and a message!  You forgot about the message!

1> Right.  Leave your name, telephone number, and a brief message after you
   hear the beep, and we will keep track of this stuff until the real people
   get back.

2> ...unless of course, sombody pulls out our plug!

------------------------------------------------
I taped theoperator saying "we're sorry.  The number you have reached
has been disconnected or is no longer is service..."

Message: Hi this is Craig's car phone.  Craig's at home now, so you can try
calling him there or leave a message after the beep.

Caller's message:  Hmmm.  Car phone!?!  I'll call back later when your out.

Every now and then we are all pestered by these high-tech telemarketing
companies where the sales pitch is usually disguised as a survey of some kind.
The despicable thing about these things is that they won't leave you
alone. If you hang up, they will just call back again.
 
One day my wife got a call from one of these computer systems, and her
answering machine answered. The conversation that followed was
hilarious, as it consisted of two machines talking to each other
without having the slightest idea about what each other was saying.
The conversation wound up in an endless loop, as follows:
 
[PHONE] *RING*
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "...At the tone, please give your message.
BEEEEEP."
 
[PHONE] "Hello. This is [company_name], and we are taking a telephone 
survey ... when I ask a question, wait for the beep, then please
speak plainly.  I will repeat your answer back to you, and verify it.
First, what is your phone number? BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
(The answering machine, upon hearing the beep, got confused and thought
 
it was a play-back command, and generated another beep in response.)
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
[PHONE] "Thank you! Your phone number was 443-28347-47756-377764-22222.
Is that correct? BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
[PHONE] "Thank you! Do you have any children? BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
[PHONE] Thank you! What is the age of your first child? BEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
[PHONE] "Your first child is 1,222 years old. Is that correct?
BEEEEEP."
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
[---------------  BEGIN ENDLESS LOOP ----------------]
 
[PHONE] "Thank you! Do you have any more children? BEEEEEEP."
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP." 
 
[PHONE] "Thank you! What is this child's age? BEEEP." 
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP." 
 
[PHONE] "This child is 4,233 years old. Is that correct? BEEEEP."
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP." 
 
[---------------------END LOOP -----------------------]
 
My wife, upon noticing that the answering machine had been going for
over half an hour, turned up the volume to find out what was going on.
When she discovered this endless loop (by now she had over 200 children,
all over 1,000 years old), she switched off the answering machine. The
computer never called again.

----------------------------------------------------
     I had a friend who liked to play with the phones.  He got his girlfriend
to sound like an operator and make a tape saying:
     "I'm sorry, the number that has dialed you is not in service.  Will
      you please hang up and let it dial again...<crackle> I'm sorry, the..."
     He had a lot of fun calling people up and playing it.

----------------------------------------------------
I once answered the phone as follows.
" San Luis Obispo Police, Sergeant McCallahan here, may I help you?"
After about five seconds of dead air, I heard a click.  About five minutes
later, the phone rang again.  This time my roomate answered.  It was the same
person that had called a few minutes earlier.  It turned out that the long 
delay between calls was due to the fact that he had to mooch a quarter for his
next call.  He was at a public phone booth and had used his last quarter to
call us.  I don't think he talked civil to me for a week...

----------------------------------------------------
     My grandmother had been bothered by calls coming in after midnight,
waking her, and forcing her out of bed and across the house to answer. 
Invariably, they were from the same man, seemingly slightly intoxicated, 
with bar-crowd noises in the background. He wanted to speak to Peggy, 
whoever that was, and my grand mother would tell him there was no Peggy 
living there, and that he must have the wrong number. But he wouldn't 
believe her, and kept insisting, begging, pleading, etc. to talk to 
Peggy. My Grandmother would have to just hang up finally.
     This went on for a few days, and late one night, when the phone rang,
my Grandfather held back his wife, and said, "I'll take care of this", and
got out of bed to answer the phone. The ensuing conversation was short and
quick, and went something like this:
     "Hello?"
     "Hello, Can I speak to Peggy?"
     "No, I'm sorry, she can't come to the phone right now-- she's nursing 
the baby."

----------------------------------------------------
Here's my favorite, for calling large offices and idiots-in-general: 
"Hello, is this the person to whom I am speaking?"

----------------------------------------------------
     My solution is upon realizing that I'm talking with a "telemarketing
representative", I ask:  "Are you a telemarketer?"  The answer
(suprisingly) is usually yes.  I then go into a sales pitch to
sell a (nonexistant) telephone ear-cusion.
     I insist that every telemarketer must have one for safety and comfort.
     Eventually, they'll forget to try selling me anything.

----------------------------------------------------
A recent posting by Duke McMullan requested ways to repel telephone 
solicitors.  My friend Pepe Tres from Texas told me this one and gave 
permission to post it:
     "My time is billed at $125 per hour.  To continue this 
     conversation, I must have your MasterCard or Visa number, card 
     type and date of expiration."
Pepe says it usually leaves them speechless.  One guy replied, "Hey, 
that's good; I'll have to remember it."  Once a supervisor of 
telephone solicitors called back and asked him if he was "some kind of 
high-powered lawyer."
----------------------------------------------------

Everybody gets and dials wrong numbers. It's good to be nice about it. What
goes around comes around, right? so, I try to reassure the apologetic and
embarrassed wrong dialers that will actually converse once the error is
discovered, with it going something like this:

caller w. wrong number: "Gee, I'm sorry..."
me:                     "That's OK, I was going to pick up the phone anyway.."

----------------------------------------------------
How about the 'Fraudian Slip Answer'? Like this:

<Whoever> here. What can I do to-----I MEAN-----FOR you?

----------------------------------------------------
Try the following next time the phone rings:

You (when you answer):  Hello, is Jimmy there?

Caller: No, I'm afraid you have a wrong number.

You: Oh.  Sorry.

Caller: No problem... (click)

	       APARTMENT FOR RENT

  A prosperous and somewhat amorous businessman propositioned a beautiful
chorus girl of well proportioned figure to spend the night with him for
$500.00.  When he was ready to leave the next morning, certain things having
transpired, he told her that he didn't have that much money with him, but he
would have his secretary mail her a check for it, made out for RENT ON
APARTMENT, to avoid embarrassment.

  On the way to the office however, after thinking the matter over, he decided
the night hadn't been worth what he had agreed to pay, so he had his secretary
send a check for $250.00 instead, and enclosed the following explanatory note:

	Dear Madam,

	Enclosed is the check in the amount of $250.00
	for rent on your apartment.  I am sending this
	amount instead of the amount originally agreed
	upon, because when I rented this apartment, I
	was under the assumption that . . .

	1)  It had never been occupied.

	2)  There was plenty of heat.

	3)  That it was small.

	Last night, I found that it had been occupied
	many times, that there wasn't much heat, and
	that it was entirely too large.

  Upon receipt of the note, the girl immediatly returned the check, with this
note .	.  .

	I am returning your check for $250.00.	I can not
	understand how you could expect such a beautiful
	apartment to remain unoccupied.  As for the heat,
	there is plenty of it if you just know how to
	turn it on.  As for the size, it's not my fault
	if you didn't have enough furniture to fill it.

I can't come to the phone now, so if, well, actually, I CAN come to the phone

                     PROFUNDITIES, WITTICISMS AND GENERAL WISDOM



It is morally wrong to allow suckers to keep their money.
Addendum; a Smith and Wesson beats four aces.  (Canada Bill Jones)

***
A pipe gives a wise man time to think
  And a fool something to put in his mouth.

***
Never underestimate the power of human stupidity.

***
Whatever goes around, comes around.

***
There is only one right way for a machine to run.  The number of
ways it can go wrong is so infinite that every operating
engineer lives in constant terror.

***
            ON WAR

Don't rejoice at the defeat, you men,
  Now that you have killed the bastard.
The bitch that bore him is in heat again.

***
ON DYING - REMEMBRANCE

Bring back my name
  On wings of flame.

Winds of the plains,
  Dance once for me.

***
                      SOULS

They will come back - come back - as long as the red earth rolls.

He never wasted a leaf or a tree.  Do you think he would
squander souls?

***
               COLDƒ IRON

Gold is for the mistress - silver for the maid -
  Copper for the craftsman, cunning at his trade.
But Iron - Cold Iron - is master of them all.

***
The number of people who agree or disagree with you has
absolutely no bearing on whether you're *right*.  The universe
has a way of deciding that for itself.

***
The truth of any proposition has nothing to do with its
credibility...and vice versa.


                     ARISTOCRAT'S CODE

The last thing you want is an educated, affluent and emancipated
population.  Power hinges on the restriction and control of
wealth.  Science and technology offer unlimited wealth.
Therefore, science and technology have to be controlled.
Knowledge and reason are enemies.  Myth and unreason are the
weapons you fight them with.

***
If you don't like yourself, you can't like other people.

***
Money is a powerful aphrodisiac.  But flowers work almost as
well.

***
It may be better to be a live jackal than a dead lion, but it is
better still to be a live lion.  And usually easier.

***
Men rarely, if ever, manage to dream up a god superior to
themselves.  Most gods have the morals and manners of a spoiled
child.

***
Place your clothes and weapons where you can find them in the
dark.

***
An Elephant;  A Mouse built to government specifications.

***
Democracy is based on the assumption that a million men are
wiser than one man. How's that again?  I missed something.

***
Autocracy is based on the assumption that one man is wiser than
a million men.  Let's play that over again too.  Who decides?

***
Taxes are not levied for the benefit of the taxed.

***
Money is the sincerest form of flattery.
Women love to be flattered.
So do men.

***
You live and learn.  Or you don't live long.

***
Only a sadistic scoundrel - or a fool - tells the bald truth on
social occasions.

***
Be wary of strong drink.  It can make you shoot at tax
collectors - and miss.

                     PRIESTS

The profession of shaman has many advantages.  It offers high
status with a safe livelihood free of work in the dreary, sweaty
sense.  In most societies it offers legal privileges and
immunities not granted to other men.  But it is hard to see how
a man who has been given a mandate from on High to spread
tidings of joy to all mankind can be seriously interested in
taking up a collection to pay his salary.  It causes one to
suspect that the shaman is on the moral level of any other con
man.  But it's lovely work if you can stomach it.

***
Tilting at windmills hurts you more than the windmills.

***
'Go to hell!' or other insult direct is all the answer a snoopy
question rates.

***
A man does not insist on physical beauty in a woman who builds
up his morale.  After a while he realizes that she *is*
beautiful - he just hadn't noticed at first.

***
Natural laws have no pity.

***
Freedom begins when you tell Mrs. Grundy to go fly a kite.

***
Political tags - such as royalist, communist, democrat,
populist, fascist, liberal, conservative, and so forth - are
never basic criteria.  The human race divides politically into
those who want people to be controlled and those who have no
such desire.  The former are idealists acting from the highest
motives of the greatest good for the greatest number.  The
latter are surly curmudgeons, suspicious and lacking in
altruism.  But they are more comfortable neighbors then the
other sort.

***
Sin lies only in hurting other people unnecessarily.  All other
'sins' are invented nonsense.  (Hurting yourself is not sinful -
just stupid.)

***
Certainly the game is rigged.  Don't let that stop you.  If you
don't bet, you can't win.

***
Delusions are often functional.  A mother's opinions about her
children's beauty, intelligence, goodness, et cetera ad nauseam,
keep her from drowning them at birth.

***
Never appeal to a man's better nature.  He may not have one.
Invoking his self-interest gives you more leverage.

***
You can have peace,  or you can have freedom.  Don't ever count
on having both at once.

***
A woman is not property.  Husbands who think otherwise are
living in a dreamworld.

***
Stupidity is not a sin.  The victim can't help being stupid.
Stupidity cannot be cured with money, or through education, or
by legislation.  But stupidity is the only universal capital
crime. The sentence is death;  there is no appeal, and
execution is carried out automatically and without pity.

***
The correct way to punctuate a sentence that starts 'Of course
it's none of my business but...' is to place a period after the
word 'but'.  Don't use excessive force in supplying such morons
with a period.  Cutting his throat is only a momentary pleasure
and is bound to get you talked about.

***
Formal courtesy between husband and wife is even more important
than it is between strangers.

***
Your friends will know you better in the first minute you meet
then your acquaintances will know you in a thousand years.

***
Argue for your limitations and, sure enough, they're yours.

***
You are never given a wish without also being given the power to
make it come true.  You may have to work for it though.

***
Here is a test to find out whether your mission on earth is
finished;  If you're alive, it isn't.

***
In order to live free and happily, you must sacrifice boredom.
It is not always an easy sacrifice.

***
There is no limit to how gently you can apply a big hammer, but
there definitely is to how hard you can hit with a small one.

***
Hey, shit happens!

***
Let he who doubts the existence of God observe the workings of
our Government, then ponder the fact that mankind survives and
prospers.

***

 Steve:  Hello.  Steve and Matt aren't here right now but if...

 Steve:  I'm leaving a phone message since we aren't here.
 Matt:  But you left the last one -- it's my turn.

 A friend of mine at school has this message, read by three people while
 the STAR TREK theme plays in the background.
      1:  Room 17, the final frontier.
      2:  These are the messages of Chad's answering machine.  Its 2 semester
          mission:  to seek out your name and your telepohne number.
      3:  To boldly inform you to wait for the tone.

 11
 (Annoying flute music in background)
 Good day, Jim.  Your contact, [insert name], is not available right now.
 Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to leave your name,
 number, and a brief message at the tone.  This tape will self-destruct
 in thirty seconds.
 Good Luck, Jim.

 "Steve is reassembling Elvis' brain and can't come to the phone right
 now, but if you leave your name ...", etc.

 13
 "Steve has been captured by a flying saucer and can't come to the phone
 right now, but if you leave your name, phone number, and a message I'll
 have him call you back as soon as he gets away.  Read all about it in
 next week's National Enquirer."

 14
 In the background can be heard Gregorian Chant or some other church music
 <In a soft voice> Good Day My child, you have reached {name} dial a confession.
 At the tone if you will leave your name, number and short confession I will get
 back to you with your pennance. Thank you and may God go with you. <Beep>

 15
         Hi this is <name>. I'm sorry I can't answer the phone right now.
         Leave a message and then wait by the phone until I call you back.

 16
 A friend was at a mutal friend's sister's house, and when she went out for
 beer, he changed her answering machine message.  In a loud, deep, gravely,
 horror-film voice he recorded, "HI, THIS IS KATHY, I'M NOT MYSELF RIGHT NOW.
 IF YOU LEAVE YOUR NAME AND NUMBER, I'LL GET BACK TO YOU WHEN I'M FEELING
 BETTER."

      I worked for a bit in the coastguard in Wales and I used to send weather
 reports to other bases, using a sort of antique FAX machine. I would call
 first on a special telephone and then send the data. They used to answer the
phone with:
     " Epicentre of the Universe, God speaking."
     " Hartland home for lost whores."  (that was Hartland CG)
     " Da, zis iz Ivan: do you have zee secret information, Boris?"
     " Pentagon command: transmit destruct sequence (pause) sequence correct:
         T minus one minute and counting"
      And then there was one phone we didn't use, with a number one off that of
 the local take-out.  With my, non-British, accent I had some great fun with
 that phone.

-     "Starship Enterprise, Uhura here, can you hold please?  -- Captain, there
 is a transmission coming in on hailing frequency seven, do you want it on
 screen?" (silence...click)
      "Vancouver coastguard, may I help you."  British long distance rates are
 phenomenonal and I had this poor dude sputtering with horror that he had
managed
 to make a long distance call by dialing five digits.

 This is one of my old ones that got a lot of laughs:


 <Phone Rings>

 Noisy pick-up of phone

 Uh...<wisperingly> Hello?

 Hi, I 'm a burgular and I was just about to steal Troy's answering machine.
 If you give me your name and number I'll..uh, I'll post it on the 'frige
 where he'll see it.  Uh.. by the way, where did you say you live?

 19----------------------------------------------------
 But right now I'm using "This is a boring answering machine message.
 Leave a message anyway." because I'm sick of people ringing the phone
 at 10am just so they can hear the clever messages I usually have, and
 then hanging up without even leaving a "like your message" message.
 Feh!

 20----------------------------------------------------
 [Must have good Australian accent]
 G'day mate.  Can't come to the phone now because I'm a bit tied up with
 this crocodile.  Just leave a message, and I'll get back to you.

 21----------------------------------------------------
 This is the Literacy Self Test Hotline.  After the tone, leave your name and
 number and recite a sentence using today's vocabulary word.  Today's word

 Also, on the subject of answering machins, my favorite tape was:

 31------------------------------------------------
 Last year my roommate had a machine but he hated to make the outgoing
 message. Stage fright, I guess. So I usually made them. One that we
 usually used during exam time was:

 {background music: Billy Joel's _Pressure_ very loud}
 Hello. You have reached Tom and Mark's room. We're a little busy now...
 { BJ screams PRESSURE!!! }
 So, leave a message and we'll get back to you someday after (exam end
 date)
 { BJ: ONE TWO THREE FOUR PRESSURE!!! followed by a very out-of-tune BEEP! }

 32------------------------------------------------
 My favorite message that I ever had was the *real* message I recorded
 off 1-800-CALL-SPY, the U.S. army snitching network. Try it, its a great

 42------------------------------------------------
 However, the most effective one I have had so far can be used only one day
 per year: "This is David.  I'm not using the phone over Yom Kippur, so please
 leave a message or call back after the holiday."  No one wants to admit not
 having realized it was Yom Kippur or not knowing I would pick one holiday from
 the whole calendar on which to get observant, so everyone hangs up and leaves
 me no bad news or requests for favors.

 43------------------------------------------------
 "This is David.  Talk."

 44------------------------------------------------
 "Hi.  This is David.  I've shut the ringers off on my phones and taken a
 sedative.  As soon as I finish this recording I'm going to bed indefinitely.
 When I wake up I'll play my messages.  Please leave one."

 reached..." [YA-DAAAAAAAAA!] "...the ANSWERING MACHINE!  Leave your name
 and number, and we will get back to you as soon as we can."

 46------------------------------------------------
 "Hello, this is Dr. Pangloss.  If this were the best of all possible worlds,
 I could come to the phone right now, but I can't, so if you could leave your
 name and number..."

 47------------------------------------------------
      "Hello?" <pause for a few seconds> "Sorry, he's not here right now,
 but if you leave a message, he'll get back to you."

 when you're a fashion model.  Sometimes I just have to ...

 Just after the earthquake a friend of mine put on his answering machine:

      "Hi, this is Jeff.  We can't get to the phone right now because we
 were killed in the Earthquake.  Tragic, isn't it?  But, leave a

-message anyway, someone is sure to get it eventually."  BEEP

 My favorite post quake message:

     "Hi, we're not in cause we're out LOOTING!
      Leave a message and we'll call you back and tell you what we got."

 50------------------------------------------------
 "Hello, I'm not hear right now.  In fact, I'm out getting a new parakeet.
  If you leave a message after the beep, I'll be sure to get back to you.
  Oh, and by the way, a word of advice; never try to clean a parakeet cage
  with a vacuum cleaner."

 51------------------------------------------------
 Ring...click....(sound of loud music in background)...Hello? - just
 a second while I turn the stereo off (sound of person running to
 click off music, which gets quiet.  sound of person running back
 to phone) OK, sorry about that, hi there, who's this...well hi!...
 uh huh...yeah...well listen you're talking to a machine, so please
 leave a message and I'll call you back.

 (this ran for a while until a friend threatened to kill us after
 she said she had a 2 minute conversation with the machine.)

 52------------------------------------------------
  "Hello, this is Jim. Unfortunately I can't answer the phone right now
   because I've just come back from the Mirror Worlds and I'm still made
   up of antimatter, so if I were to pick up the phone right now, the
   resulting energy release would make Hiroshima look like a wet firecracker.
   So leave a message at the tone and I'll get back to you as soon as my
   component particles have been restored to their normal charges."

  "Hello, I'm not here." <beep>
   A friend of mine used this one last summer. I always answered it with
   "Okay, that's all I wanted to know."

    Hi!! You've reached Janet and Chris's room. We're not in right now.
 If this is our parents, we're at the library studying. Yeah, yeah,
 that's it, that's the ticket. If this is John (Chris's boyfriend), Chris
 is out with the girls at the party. Yeah, that's it. If this is any one
 else, we're at a party and you're not. Yeah, a party with the president.
 Yeah and the .... pope. Yeah that's it. <beep>

 The machine answering this message is connected to a 5000 volt power

 before you leave a message, it will complete the circuit and will fry
 the kitty.  The choice is YOURS....   BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP

         I can't come to the phone now, so if, well, actually, I CAN come

         this message, but I'm doing this NOW, while you're listening to
         it LATER, except for you I guess it's NOW, like, when you're

         a beep...

         You're growing tired.  Your eyelids are getting heavy.  You feel
         very sleepy now.  You are gradually losing your willpower and
         your ability to resist suggestions.  When you hear the tone you
         will feel helplessly compelled to leave your name, number, and a
         message.

         No!  NO!  Not THAT!  Anything but that!  Not the beep!  No!

         secrets, such as my desire to be kidnapped by short blonde sorority

 Another one I've done more than once is to slowly increase the pitch

         This is not an answering machine -- this is a telepathic
         thought-recording device.  After the tone, think about your
         name, your reason for calling, and a number where I can reach
         you, and I'll think about returning your call.

 My favorite that I have heard as an answering machine message is also
 from this movie.  My friend recorded the section that goes something
 like:

         "I'm writing the definative work on pain, and I would like you
 to tell me how the machine makes you feel.  Remember, be honest.  This
 is for posterity."

 108------------------------------------------------
 The message I currently have on my recorder is the output from my Amiga's
 speech sythesizer.  It's set up as a dialog between two distict, but
 recognizably artificial voices.  I thought it sort of mediocre myself, but
 have gotten quite a number of amused comments about it.
 -----
 1> Hello, there are no real people here to answer the phone right now.

 2> Yeah, nobody but us machines!

 1> Right, just us machines, but don't hang up!  If you like, you can leave
    your name and telephone number...

 2> ...and a message!  You forgot about the message!

 1> Right.  Leave your name, telephone number, and a brief message after you
    hear the beep, and we will keep track of this stuff until the real people
    get back.

 2> ...unless of course, sombody pulls out our plug!

 Every now and then we are all pestered by these high-tech telemarketing
 companies where the sales pitch is usually disguised as a survey of some kind.
 The despicable thing about these things is that they won't leave you
 alone. If you hang up, they will just call back again.

 One day my wife got a call from one of these computer systems, and her
 answering machine answered. The conversation that followed was
 hilarious, as it consisted of two machines talking to each other
 without having the slightest idea about what each other was saying.
 The conversation wound up in an endless loop, as follows:

 [PHONE] *RING*

 [ANSWERING MACHINE] "...At the tone, please give your message.
 BEEEEEP."

 [PHONE] "Hello. This is [company_name], and we are taking a telephone
 survey ... when I ask a question, wait for the beep, then please
 speak plainly.  I will repeat your answer back to you, and verify it.

-First, what is your phone number? BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

 (The answering machine, upon hearing the beep, got confused and thought

 it was a play-back command, and generated another beep in response.)

 [ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

 [PHONE] "Thank you! Your phone number was 443-28347-47756-377764-22222.
 Is that correct? BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

 [ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

 [PHONE] "Thank you! Do you have any children? BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

 [ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

 [PHONE] Thank you! What is the age of your first child? BEEEEEEEEEEP."

 [---------------------END LOOP -----------------------]

 My wife, upon noticing that the answering machine had been going for
 over half an hour, turned up the volume to find out what was going on.
 When she discovered this endless loop (by now she had over 200 children,
 all over 1,000 years old), she switched off the answering machine. The
 computer never called again.

      I had a friend who liked to play with the phones.  He got his girlfriend
 to sound like an operator and make a tape saying:
      "I'm sorry, the number that has dialed you is not in service.  Will
       you please hang up and let it dial again...<crackle> I'm sorry, the..."
      He had a lot of fun calling people up and playing it.

 I once answered the phone as follows.
 " San Luis Obispo Police, Sergeant McCallahan here, may I help you?"
 After about five seconds of dead air, I heard a click.  About five minutes
 later, the phone rang again.  This time my roomate answered.  It was the same
 person that had called a few minutes earlier.  It turned out that the long
 delay between calls was due to the fact that he had to mooch a quarter for his
 next call.  He was at a public phone booth and had used his last quarter to
 call us.  I don't think he talked civil to me for a week...

 117----------------------------------------------------
      My grandmother had been bothered by calls coming in after midnight,
 waking her, and forcing her out of bed and across the house to answer.
 Invariably, they were from the same man, seemingly slightly intoxicated,
 with bar-crowd noises in the background. He wanted to speak to Peggy,
 whoever that was, and my grand mother would tell him there was no Peggy
 living there, and that he must have the wrong number. But he wouldn't
 believe her, and kept insisting, begging, pleading, etc. to talk to
 Peggy. My Grandmother would have to just hang up finally.
      This went on for a few days, and late one night, when the phone rang,
 my Grandfather held back his wife, and said, "I'll take care of this", and
 got out of bed to answer the phone. The ensuing conversation was short and
 quick, and went something like this:
      "Hello?"
      "Hello, Can I speak to Peggy?"
      "No, I'm sorry, she can't come to the phone right now-- she's nursing
 the baby."

 118----------------------------------------------------
 Here's my favorite, for calling large offices and idiots-in-general:
 "Hello, is this the person to whom I am speaking?"

 119----------------------------------------------------
      My solution is upon realizing that I'm talking with a "telemarketing
 representative", I ask:  "Are you a telemarketer?"  The answer
 (suprisingly) is usually yes.  I then go into a sales pitch to
 sell a (nonexistant) telephone ear-cusion.
      I insist that every telemarketer must have one for safety and comfort.
      Eventually, they'll forget to try selling me anything.

 120----------------------------------------------------
 A recent posting by Duke McMullan requested ways to repel telephone
 solicitors.  My friend Pepe Tres from Texas told me this one and gave
 permission to post it:
      "My time is billed at $125 per hour.  To continue this
      conversation, I must have your MasterCard or Visa number, card
      type and date of expiration."
 Pepe says it usually leaves them speechless.  One guy replied, "Hey,
 that's good; I'll have to remember it."  Once a supervisor of
 telephone solicitors called back and asked him if he was "some kind of
 high-powered lawyer."
 121----------------------------------------------------

 Everybody gets and dials wrong numbers. It's good to be nice about it. What
 goes around comes around, right? so, I try to reassure the apologetic and

1FILE: ANS      MSGS     D1                VM/ESA Conversational Monitor System
PAGE 00018
-embarrassed wrong dialers that will actually converse once the error is
 discovered, with it going something like this:

 caller w. wrong number: "Gee, I'm sorry..."
 me:                     "That's OK, I was going to pick up the phone anyway.."

 122----------------------------------------------------
 How about the 'Fraudian Slip Answer'? Like this:

 <Whoever> here. What can I do to-----I MEAN-----FOR you?

 123----------------------------------------------------
 Try the following next time the phone rings:

 You (when you answer):  Hello, is Jimmy there?

 Caller: No, I'm afraid you have a wrong number.

 You: Oh.  Sorry.

 Caller: No problem... (click)

 124----------------------------------------------------
 (Use a strong east Indian accent)

 Hello, you have reached the existential hotline of (...).
 I am currently meditating, but if you leave your name and
 which lifeline you are currently inhabiting at the sound of
 the Om, I will send good karma waves and contact you when
 the stars align properly.
 Oooooommmmmmmmmmmmm...

 125
 (heavy panting and breathing in the background), Oh!  Sorry,
 I can't come (Oh! Yes!  Do it to me) to the (Oh!) phone right
 now (pant pant), leave your name and number at the
 (scream) (I'm gonna come!!!!!) orgasm.


 126
 (1) "Hello, this is Ron.  (pause)   Hello?   Hello!!?    Nah, just
 kidding.  This is an answering machine. (etc.)"
 127
 (2) "Hello, this is Ron.  I'm not home right now, but I can take a
 message.  Hang on a second while I get a pencil."  (background noise -
 open a drawer and shuffle stuff around.)  "OK, what would you like me
 to tell me?"
 128
 Also, something you might do after you've had the machine for a few
 months is start answering in person with "Hello, this is a live
 voice."  (Variation on a theme by "The Cosby Show".)  Or you could try
 answering your own phone with "Hello, is Ron there?"

 I actually did this once when a call came in at an inopportune moment:
 I picked up the phone, said "Hi, this is Chris.  I can't come to the phone
 right now, so please leave a message after the tone.  -EEEEE-" -- that
 last being a tone-like sound - and the caller proceeded to leave name,
 phone number, and message, and hang up.  I went back to what I'd been
 doing.



         Before I bought an answering machine, I thought I didn't need
         one.  Then I started thinking up possible messages, and before
         long I had bought an answering machine just so I could put my
         messages on it.  Here they are.  There are plenty of them...

         machine messages, but if you know what The Shredder has done to

         of a decent pizza recipe, just leave your name and number and
         we'll ring you right back.  But don't say anything yet!  Enemy
         agents may be listening.  When the computer has checked they're
         not eavesdropping, it will make a bleeping noise and you can
         speak freely.

 Dial some number at random. Ask: "May I speak to Kevin? Oh, wrong number?
 Could you please tell him that his pizza is ready?". Hang up.

 Dial the same number again 15 minutes later. In a different voice: "May I
 speak to Kevin? Oh, wrong number? Could you please tell him that John
 called?". Hang up.

 Repeat 10 times. On the eleventh: "Hi, this is Kevin. Did I get any
 messages?"

 Dial a number. "Hello, this is your local telephone station speaking. We
 are sorry to tell you but we are having a terrible fire here at the
 station. The fire cannot be controlled, it is spreading over telephone
 cables and will reach your house in 5 minutes. So, if you don't want to
 burn down your house, hurry up and take your
 telephone receiver and throw it into a bucket of cold water!"

 Sometimes it works, and people do throw their receivers into water. It is
 especially amusing to play this joke on the people whom you intend to visit
 later in the day. That way you can come and inspect the damage.

 "Hello, this is your local Zoo speaking. Do you like animals? We are
 experiencing severe problems with hot water. Would you be so kind as to allow
 us to bring our elephants over to your bathroom for a shower?"

 The most common response: "Well, sure, but my neighbour's bathroom is
 bigger and better equipped to handle elephants."

 really exist.  One way to find out, leave a message and if its reality I will
 call you back.

A guy's driving down a country road when he comes upon a sign saying "Apples - $5.00 each."He thinks that that is a lot of money
so he decides to go see what's up.He goes up to the farmer and says, "Hey, how come these apples are 5 bucks each?"

The farmer replies, "They are peanut butter and jelly apples." The farmer hands him one and says, "Here, try one."So the man
takes a bite out of the apple and says, "Peanut butter - that's great, but I thought you said that they were peanut butter and 
jelly apples."

The farmer tells the man to turn it around.The man bites the other side and exclaims "son of a gun - jelly!" The man says, "These
apples are great - give me some." He gets back in his car and drives a little further down the road and then sees another sign 
"Apples - $10 each."Again, he pulls over, goes to the farmer and says, "Hey, what's up with these apples?"

The farmer says, "They're ham and cheese apples.Here, try one." The guy takes a bit and exclaims, "Son of a gun - ham!" The guy 
then says, "Let me guess- I have to turn it around."  The farmer says "You got it." The guy bites the other side and says,
"Cheese."Again the man says, "These apples are great - give me some."

Then he gets back in his car and drives down the road.  He comes upon a third sign that says "Apples - $50 each."The guy really
wants to see what's up with these apples.Again, he pulls over, goes up to the farmer and says, "What's the deal with these apples? 
50 bucks each?"

The farmer tells him that "These apples are pussy apples. Here, try one." The guy takes a bite out of it and says, "Yuck, this
apple tastes like crap." The farmer says, "Turn it around!"

                     SUN TZU ON THE ART OF WAR 
            THE OLDEST MILITARY TREATISE IN THE WORLD 

                    Translated from the Chinese 
                    By LIONEL GILES, M.A. (1910)



[This is the basic text of Sun Tzu on the Art of War.  It was
extracted from Mr. Giles' complete work as titled above.  The
commentary itself, which, of course includes this work embedded
within it, has been released as suntzu10.txt (or suntzu10.zip).
This is being released only as an adjunct to that work, which
contains a wealth of commentary upon this text.]




I. LAYING PLANS


 1. Sun Tzu said:  The art of war is of vital importance
    to the State.

 2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either
    to safety or to ruin.  Hence it is a subject of inquiry
    which can on no account be neglected.

 3. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant
    factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations,
    when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.

 4. These are:  (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth;
    (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.

5,6. The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete
    accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him
    regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.

 7. Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat,
    times and seasons.

 8. Earth comprises distances, great and small;
    danger and security; open ground and narrow passes;
    the chances of life and death.

 9. The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom,
    sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.

10. By method and discipline are to be understood
    the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions,
    the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance
    of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the
    control of military expenditure.

11. These five heads should be familiar to every general: 
    he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them
    not will fail.

12. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking
    to determine the military conditions, let them be made
    the basis of a comparison, in this wise:--

13. (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued
        with the Moral law?
    (2) Which of the two generals has most ability?
    (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven
        and Earth?
    (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?
    (5) Which army is stronger?
    (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained?
    (7) In which army is there the greater constancy
        both in reward and punishment?

14. By means of these seven considerations I can
    forecast victory or defeat.

15. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts
    upon it, will conquer:  let such a one be retained in command! 
    The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it,
    will suffer defeat:--let such a one be dismissed!

16. While heading the profit of my counsel,
    avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances
    over and beyond the ordinary rules.

17. According as circumstances are favorable,
    one should modify one's plans.

18. All warfare is based on deception.

19. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable;
    when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we
    are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away;
    when far away, we must make him believe we are near.

20. Hold out baits to entice the enemy.  Feign disorder,
    and crush him.

21. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. 
    If he is in superior strength, evade him.

22. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to
    irritate him.  Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.

23. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. 
    If his forces are united, separate them.

24. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where
    you are not expected.

25. These military devices, leading to victory,
    must not be divulged beforehand.

26. Now the general who wins a battle makes many
    calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. 
    The general who loses a battle makes but few
    calculations beforehand.  Thus do many calculations
    lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: 
    how much more no calculation at all!  It is by attention
    to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.


II. WAGING WAR


 1. Sun Tzu said:  In the operations of war,
    where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots,
    as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand
    mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry them
    a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front,
    including entertainment of guests, small items such as
    glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor,
    will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. 
    Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.

 2. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory
    is long in coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and
    their ardor will be damped.  If you lay siege to a town,
    you will exhaust your strength.
 3. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources
    of the State will not be equal to the strain.

 4. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped,
    your strength exhausted and your treasure spent,
    other chieftains will spring up to take advantage
    of your extremity.  Then no man, however wise,
    will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.

 5. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war,
    cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.

 6. There is no instance of a country having benefited
    from prolonged warfare.

 7. It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted
    with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand
    the profitable way of carrying it on.

 8. The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy,
    neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.

 9. Bring war material with you from home, but forage
    on the enemy.  Thus the army will have food enough
    for its needs.

10. Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army
    to be maintained by contributions from a distance. 
    Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes
    the people to be impoverished.

11. On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes
    prices to go up; and high prices cause the people's
    substance to be drained away.

12. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry
    will be afflicted by heavy exactions.

13,14. With this loss of substance and exhaustion
    of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare,
    and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated;
    while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses,
    breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields,
    protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons,
    will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.

15. Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging
    on the enemy.  One cartload of the enemy's provisions
    is equivalent to twenty of one's own, and likewise
    a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty
    from one's own store.

16. Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must
    be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from
    defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.

17. Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots
    have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. 
    Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy,
    and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. 
    The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.

18. This is called, using the conquered foe to augment
    one's own strength.

19. In war, then, let your great object be victory,
    not lengthy campaigns.

20. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies
    is the arbiter of the people's fate, the man on whom it
    depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.


III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM


 1. Sun Tzu said:  In the practical art of war, the best
    thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact;
    to shatter and destroy it is not so good.  So, too, it is
    better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it,
    to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire
    than to destroy them.

 2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles
    is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists
    in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.

 3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to
    balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent
    the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in
    order is to attack the enemy's army in the field;
    and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.

 4. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it
    can possibly be avoided.  The preparation of mantlets,
    movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take
    up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over
    against the walls will take three months more.

 5. The general, unable to control his irritation,
    will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants,
    with the result that one-third of his men are slain,
    while the town still remains untaken.  Such are the disastrous
    effects of a siege.

 6. Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's
    troops without any fighting; he captures their cities
    without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom
    without lengthy operations in the field.

 7. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery
    of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph
    will be complete.  This is the method of attacking by stratagem.

 8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten
    to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one,
    to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army
    into two.

 9. If equally matched, we can offer battle;
    if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy;
    if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.

10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made
    by a small force, in the end it must be captured
    by the larger force.

11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State;
    if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will
    be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will
    be weak.

12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring
    misfortune upon his army:--

13. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat,
    being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. 
    This is called hobbling the army.

14. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the
    same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant
    of the conditions which obtain in an army.  This causes
    restlessness in the soldier's minds.

15. (3) By employing the officers of his army
    without discrimination, through ignorance of the
    military principle of adaptation to circumstances. 
    This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.

16. But when the army is restless and distrustful,
    trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. 
    This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging
    victory away.

17. Thus we may know that there are five essentials
    for victory:
    (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when
        not to fight.
    (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior
        and inferior forces.
    (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same
        spirit throughout all its ranks.
    (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take
        the enemy unprepared.
    (5) He will win who has military capacity and is
        not interfered with by the sovereign.

18. Hence the saying:  If you know the enemy
    and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a
    hundred battles.  If you know yourself but not the enemy,
    for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. 
    If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will
    succumb in every battle.


IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS


 1. Sun Tzu said:  The good fighters of old first put
    themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then
    waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.

 2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our
    own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy
    is provided by the enemy himself.
 3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat,
    but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.

 4. Hence the saying:  One may know how to conquer
    without being able to do it.

 5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics;
    ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.

 6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient
    strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.

 7. The general who is skilled in defense hides in the
    most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in
    attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven. 
    Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves;
    on the other, a victory that is complete.

 8. To see victory only when it is within the ken
    of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.

 9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight
    and conquer and the whole Empire says, "Well done!"

10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength;
    to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight;
    to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.

11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is
    one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.

12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation
    for wisdom nor credit for courage.

13. He wins his battles by making no mistakes. 
    Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty
    of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is
    already defeated.

14. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into
    a position which makes defeat impossible, and does
    not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.

15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist
    only seeks battle after the victory has been won,
    whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights
    and afterwards looks for victory.

16. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law,
    and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is
    in his power to control success.

17. In respect of military method, we have,
    firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity;
    thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances;
    fifthly, Victory.

18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth;
    Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to
    Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation;
    and Victory to Balancing of chances.

19. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as
    a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.

20. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting
    of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.


V. ENERGY


 1. Sun Tzu said:  The control of a large force
    is the same principle as the control of a few men: 
    it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.

 2. Fighting with a large army under your command
    is nowise different from fighting with a small one: 
    it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.

 3. To ensure that your whole host may withstand
    the brunt of the enemy's attack and remain unshaken--
    this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect.

 4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone
    dashed against an egg--this is effected by the science
    of weak points and strong.

 5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used
    for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed
    in order to secure victory.

 6. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible
    as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams;
    like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew;
    like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.

 7. There are not more than five musical notes,
    yet the combinations of these five give rise to more
    melodies than can ever be heard.

 8. There are not more than five primary colors
    (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination
    they produce more hues than can ever been seen.

 9. There are not more than five cardinal tastes
    (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations
    of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.

10. In battle, there are not more than two methods
    of attack--the direct and the indirect; yet these two
    in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.

11. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. 
    It is like moving in a circle--you never come to an end. 
    Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?

12. The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent
    which will even roll stones along in its course.

13. The quality of decision is like the well-timed
    swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy
    its victim.

14. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible
    in his onset, and prompt in his decision.

15. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow;
    decision, to the releasing of a trigger.

16. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may
    be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all;
    amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head
    or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.

17. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline,
    simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness
    postulates strength.

18. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is
    simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under
    a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy;
    masking strength with weakness is to be effected
    by tactical dispositions.

19. Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy
    on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to
    which the enemy will act.  He sacrifices something,
    that the enemy may snatch at it.

20. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march;
    then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.

21. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined
    energy, and does not require too much from individuals. 
    Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize
    combined energy.

22. When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting
    men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. 
    For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain
    motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope;
    if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if
    round-shaped, to go rolling down.

23. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men
    is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain
    thousands of feet in height.  So much on the subject
    of energy.


VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG


 1. Sun Tzu said:  Whoever is first in the field and
    awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight;
    whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle
    will arrive exhausted.

 2. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on
    the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.

 3. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy
    to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage,
    he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.

 4. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him;
    if well supplied with food, he can starve him out;
    if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.

 5. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend;
    march swiftly to places where you are not expected.

 6. An army may march great distances without distress,
    if it marches through country where the enemy is not.

 7. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks
    if you only attack places which are undefended.You can
    ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold
    positions that cannot be attacked.

 8. Hence that general is skillful in attack whose
    opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful
    in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.

 9. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy!  Through you
    we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible;
    and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.

10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible,
    if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire
    and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid
    than those of the enemy.

11. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced
    to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high
    rampart and a deep ditch.  All we need do is attack
    some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.

12. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent
    the enemy from engaging us even though the lines
    of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. 
    All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable
    in his way.

13. By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining
    invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated,
    while the enemy's must be divided.

14. We can form a single united body, while the
    enemy must split up into fractions.  Hence there will
    be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole,
    which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.

15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force
    with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.

16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be
    made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare
    against a possible attack at several different points;
    and his forces being thus distributed in many directions,
    the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will
    be proportionately few.

17. For should the enemy strengthen his van,
    he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear,
    he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left,
    he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right,
    he will weaken his left.  If he sends reinforcements everywhere,
    he will everywhere be weak.

18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare
    against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling
    our adversary to make these preparations against us.

19. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle,
    we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order
    to fight.

20. But if neither time nor place be known,
    then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right,
    the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van
    unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. 
    How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are
    anything under a hundred LI apart, and even the nearest
    are separated by several LI!

21. Though according to my estimate the soldiers
    of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage
    them nothing in the matter of victory.  I say then
    that victory can be achieved.

22. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may
    prevent him from fighting.  Scheme so as to discover
    his plans and the likelihood of their success.

23. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his
    activity or inactivity.  Force him to reveal himself,
    so as to find out his vulnerable spots.

24. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own,
    so that you may know where strength is superabundant
    and where it is deficient.

25. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch
    you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions,
    and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies,
    from the machinations of the wisest brains.

26. How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's
    own tactics--that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.

27. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer,
    but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory
    is evolved.

28. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained
    you one victory, but let your methods be regulated
    by the infinite variety of circumstances.

29. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its
    natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.

30. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong
    and to strike at what is weak.

31. Water shapes its course according to the nature
    of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works
    out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.

32. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape,
    so in warfare there are no constant conditions.

33. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his
    opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called
    a heaven-born captain.

34. The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth)
    are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make
    way for each other in turn.  There are short days and long;
    the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.


VII. MANEUVERING


 1. Sun Tzu said:  In war, the general receives his
    commands from the sovereign.

 2. Having collected an army and concentrated his forces,
    he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof
    before pitching his camp.

 3. After that, comes tactical maneuvering,
    than which there is nothing more difficult. 
    The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists
    in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.

 4. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route,
    after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting
    after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him,
    shows knowledge of the artifice of DEVIATION.

 5. Maneuvering with an army is advantageous;
    with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.

 6. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order
    to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be
    too late.  On the other hand, to detach a flying column
    for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage
    and stores.

 7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their
    buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day
    or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch,
    doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage,
    the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into
    the hands of the enemy.

 8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded
    ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth
    of your army will reach its destination.

 9. If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver
    the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division,
    and only half your force will reach the goal.

10. If you march thirty LI with the same object,
    two-thirds of your army will arrive.

11. We may take it then that an army without its
    baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost;
    without bases of supply it is lost.

12. We cannot enter into alliances until we are
    acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.

13. We are not fit to lead an army on the march
    unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its
    mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices,
    its marshes and swamps.

14. We shall be unable to turn natural advantage
    to account unless we make use of local guides.

15. In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.

16. Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops,
    must be decided by circumstances.

17. Let your rapidity be that of the wind,
    your compactness that of the forest.

18. In raiding and plundering be like fire,
    is immovability like a mountain.

19. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night,
    and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.

20. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be
    divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory,
    cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.

21. Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.

22. He will conquer who has learnt the artifice
    of deviation.  Such is the art of maneuvering.

23. The Book of Army Management says:  On the field
    of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: 
    hence the institution of gongs and drums.  Nor can ordinary
    objects be seen clearly enough:  hence the institution
    of banners and flags.

24. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means
    whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused
    on one particular point.

25. The host thus forming a single united body,
    is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone,
    or for the cowardly to retreat alone.  This is the art
    of handling large masses of men.

26. In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires
    and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners,
    as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.

27. A whole army may be robbed of its spirit;
    a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.

28. Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning;
    by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening,
    his mind is bent only on returning to camp.

29. A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when
    its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish
    and inclined to return.  This is the art of studying moods.

30. Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance
    of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:--this is the art
    of retaining self-possession.

31. To be near the goal while the enemy is still
    far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is
    toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy
    is famished:--this is the art of husbanding one's strength.

32. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose
    banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking
    an army drawn up in calm and confident array:--this
    is the art of studying circumstances.

33. It is a military axiom not to advance uphill
    against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.

34. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight;
    do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.

35. Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. 
    Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.

36. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. 
    Do not press a desperate foe too hard.

37. Such is the art of warfare.


VIII. VARIATION IN TACTICS


 1. Sun Tzu said:  In war, the general receives
    his commands from the sovereign, collects his army
    and concentrates his forces

 2. When in difficult country, do not encamp.  In country
    where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. 
    Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions. 
    In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. 
    In desperate position, you must fight.

 3. There are roads which must not be followed,
    armies which must be not attacked, towns which must
    be besieged, positions which must not be contested,
    commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.

 4. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages
    that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle
    his troops.

 5. The general who does not understand these, may be well
    acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he
    will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.

 6. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art
    of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted
    with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use
    of his men.

 7. Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of
    advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.

 8. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in
    this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential
    part of our schemes.

 9. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties
    we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate
    ourselves from misfortune.

10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage
    on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them
    constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements,
    and make them rush to any given point.

11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the
    likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness
    to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking,
    but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.

12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect
    a general:
    (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction;
    (2) cowardice, which leads to capture;
    (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults;
    (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame;
    (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him
        to worry and trouble.

13. These are the five besetting sins of a general,
    ruinous to the conduct of war.

14. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain,
    the cause will surely be found among these five
    dangerous faults.  Let them be a subject of meditation.


IX.  THE ARMY ON THE MARCH


 1. Sun Tzu said:  We come now to the question of
    encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy. 
    Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood
    of valleys.

 2. Camp in high places, facing the sun.  Do not climb
    heights in order to fight.  So much for mountain warfare.

 3. After crossing a river, you should get far away
    from it.

 4. When an invading force crosses a river in its
    onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream.
    It will be best to let half the army get across,
    and then deliver your attack.

 5. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go
    to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross.

 6. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing
    the sun.  Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy. 
    So much for river warfare.

 7. In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern
    should be to get over them quickly, without any delay.

 8. If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should
    have water and grass near you, and get your back
    to a clump of trees.  So much for operations in salt-marches.

 9. In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible
    position with rising ground to your right and on your rear,
    so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. 
    So much for campaigning in flat country.

10. These are the four useful branches of military
    knowledge which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish
    four several sovereigns.

11. All armies prefer high ground to low and sunny
    places to dark.

12. If you are careful of your men, and camp on hard
    ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind,
    and this will spell victory.

13. When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the
    sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. 
    Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers
    and utilize the natural advantages of the ground.

14. When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country,
    a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked
    with foam, you must wait until it subsides.

15. Country in which there are precipitous cliffs
    with torrents running between, deep natural hollows,
    confined places, tangled thickets, quagmires and crevasses,
    should be left with all possible speed and not approached.

16. While we keep away from such places, we should
    get the enemy to approach them; while we face them,
    we should let the enemy have them on his rear.

17. If in the neighborhood of your camp there should
    be any hilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass,
    hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick
    undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched;
    for these are places where men in ambush or insidious
    spies are likely to be lurking.

18. When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet,
    he is relying on the natural strength of his position.

19. When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle,
    he is anxious for the other side to advance.

20. If his place of encampment is easy of access,
    he is tendering a bait.

21. Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the
    enemy is advancing.  The appearance of a number of screens
    in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.

22. The rising of birds in their flight is the sign
    of an ambuscade.  Startled beasts indicate that a sudden
    attack is coming.

23. When there is dust rising in a high column,
    it is the sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low,
    but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach
    of infantry.  When it branches out in different directions,
    it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. 
    A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army
    is encamping.

24. Humble words and increased preparations are signs
    that the enemy is about to advance.  Violent language
    and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he
    will retreat.

25. When the light chariots come out first and take
    up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy
    is forming for battle.

26. Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant
    indicate a plot.

27. When there is much running about and the soldiers
    fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come.

28. When some are seen advancing and some retreating,
    it is a lure.

29. When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears,
    they are faint from want of food.

30. If those who are sent to draw water begin
    by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst.

31. If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and
    makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.

32. If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied. 
    Clamor by night betokens nervousness.

33. If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's
    authority is weak.  If the banners and flags are shifted
    about, sedition is afoot.  If the officers are angry,
    it means that the men are weary.

34. When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills
    its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their
    cooking-pots over the camp-fires, showing that they
    will not return to their tents, you may know that they
    are determined to fight to the death.

35. The sight of men whispering together in small
    knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection
    amongst the rank and file.

36. Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is
    at the end of his resources; too many punishments betray
    a condition of dire distress.

37. To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright
    at the enemy's numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.

38. When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths,
    it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.

39. If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain
    facing ours for a long time without either joining
    battle or taking themselves off again, the situation
    is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.

40. If our troops are no more in number than the enemy,
    that is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack
    can be made.  What we can do is simply to concentrate all
    our available strength, keep a close watch on the enemy,
    and obtain reinforcements.

41. He who exercises no forethought but makes light
    of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.

42. If soldiers are punished before they have grown
    attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and,
    unless submissive, then will be practically useless. 
    If, when the soldiers have become attached to you,
    punishments are not enforced, they will still be unless.

43. Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first
    instance with humanity, but kept under control by means
    of iron discipline.  This is a certain road to victory.

44. If in training soldiers commands are habitually
    enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not,
    its discipline will be bad.

45. If a general shows confidence in his men but always
    insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.


X. TERRAIN


 1. Sun Tzu said:  We may distinguish six kinds of terrain,
    to wit:  (1) Accessible ground; (2) entangling ground;
    (3) temporizing ground; (4) narrow passes; (5) precipitous
    heights; (6) positions at a great distance from the enemy.

 2. Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides
    is called accessible.

 3. With regard to ground of this nature, be before
    the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots,
    and carefully guard your line of supplies.  Then you
    will be able to fight with advantage.

 4. Ground which can be abandoned but is hard
    to re-occupy is called entangling.

 5. From a position of this sort, if the enemy
    is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. 
    But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you
    fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible,
    disaster will ensue.

 6. When the position is such that neither side will gain
    by making the first move, it is called temporizing ground.

 7. In a position of this sort, even though the enemy
    should offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable
    not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing
    the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has
    come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.

 8. With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy
    them first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await
    the advent of the enemy.

 9. Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass,
    do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned,
    but only if it is weakly garrisoned.

10. With regard to precipitous heights, if you are
    beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the
    raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.

11. If the enemy has occupied them before you,
    do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.

12. If you are situated at a great distance from
    the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal,
    it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be
    to your disadvantage.

13. These six are the principles connected with Earth. 
    The general who has attained a responsible post must be
    careful to study them.

14. Now an army is exposed to six several calamities,
    not arising from natural causes, but from faults
    for which the general is responsible.  These are: 
    (1) Flight; (2) insubordination; (3) collapse; (4) ruin;
    (5) disorganization; (6) rout.

15. Other conditions being equal, if one force is
    hurled against another ten times its size, the result
    will be the flight of the former.

16. When the common soldiers are too strong and
    their officers too weak, the result is insubordination. 
    When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers
    too weak, the result is collapse.

17. When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate,
    and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account
    from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief
    can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight,
    the result is ruin.

18. When the general is weak and without authority;
    when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there
    are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men,
    and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner,
    the result is utter disorganization.

19. When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's
    strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one,
    or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one,
    and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank,
    the result must be rout.

20. These are six ways of courting defeat, which must
    be carefully noted by the general who has attained
    a responsible post.

21. The natural formation of the country is the soldier's
    best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary,
    of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly
    calculating difficulties, dangers and distances,
    constitutes the test of a great general.

22. He who knows these things, and in fighting puts
    his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. 
    He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely
    be defeated.

23. If fighting is sure to result in victory,
    then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it;
    if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not
    fight even at the ruler's bidding.

24. The general who advances without coveting fame
    and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only
    thought is to protect his country and do good service
    for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.

25. Regard your soldiers as your children, and they
    will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them
    as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you
    even unto death.

26. If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make
    your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce
    your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: 
    then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children;
    they are useless for any practical purpose.

27. If we know that our own men are in a condition
    to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open
    to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.

28. If we know that the enemy is open to attack,
    but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition
    to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.

29. If we know that the enemy is open to attack,
    and also know that our men are in a condition to attack,
    but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes
    fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway
    towards victory.

30. Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion,
    is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never
    at a loss.

31. Hence the saying:  If you know the enemy and
    know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt;
    if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your
    victory complete.


XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS


 1. Sun Tzu said:  The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground:
    (1) Dispersive ground; (2) facile ground; (3) contentious ground;
    (4) open ground; (5) ground of intersecting highways;
    (6) serious ground; (7) difficult ground; (8) hemmed-in ground;
    (9) desperate ground.

 2. When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory,
    it is dispersive ground.

 3. When he has penetrated into hostile territory,
    but to no great distance, it is facile ground.

 4. Ground the possession of which imports great
    advantage to either side, is contentious ground.

 5. Ground on which each side has liberty of movement
    is open ground.

 6. Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states,
    so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire
    at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways.

 7. When an army has penetrated into the heart of a
    hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities
    in its rear, it is serious ground.

 8. Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens--all
    country that is hard to traverse:  this is difficult ground.

 9. Ground which is reached through narrow gorges,
    and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths,
    so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush
    a large body of our men:  this is hemmed in ground.

10. Ground on which we can only be saved from
    destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground.

11. On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. 
    On facile ground, halt not.  On contentious ground,
    attack not.

12. On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way. 
    On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands
    with your allies.

13. On serious ground, gather in plunder. 
    In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.

14. On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. 
    On desperate ground, fight.

15. Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew
    how to drive a wedge between the enemy's front and rear;
    to prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions;
    to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad,
    the officers from rallying their men.

16. When the enemy's men were united, they managed
    to keep them in disorder.

17. When it was to their advantage, they made
    a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still.

18. If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy
    in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack,
    I should say:  "Begin by seizing something which your
    opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will."

19. Rapidity is the essence of war:  take advantage of
    the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes,
    and attack unguarded spots.

20. The following are the principles to be observed
    by an invading force:  The further you penetrate into
    a country, the greater will be the solidarity of your troops,
    and thus the defenders will not prevail against you.

21. Make forays in fertile country in order to supply
    your army with food.

22. Carefully study the well-being of your men,
    and do not overtax them.  Concentrate your energy and hoard
    your strength.  Keep your army continually on the move,
    and devise unfathomable plans.

23. Throw your soldiers into positions whence there
    is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. 
    If they will face death, there is nothing they may
    not achieve.  Officers and men alike will put forth
    their uttermost strength.

24. Soldiers when in desperate straits lose
    the sense of fear.  If there is no place of refuge,
    they will stand firm.  If they are in hostile country,
    they will show a stubborn front.  If there is no help
    for it, they will fight hard.

25. Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers
    will be constantly on the qui vive; without waiting to
    be asked, they will do your will; without restrictions,
    they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can
    be trusted.

26. Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with
    superstitious doubts.  Then, until death itself comes,
    no calamity need be feared.

27. If our soldiers are not overburdened with money,
    it is not because they have a distaste for riches;
    if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they
    are disinclined to longevity.

28. On the day they are ordered out to battle,
    your soldiers may weep, those sitting up bedewing
    their garments, and those lying down letting the tears run
    down their cheeks.  But let them once be brought to bay,
    and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei.

29. The skillful tactician may be likened to the
    shuai-jan. Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found
    in the ChUng mountains.  Strike at its head, and you
    will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you
    will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle,
    and you will be attacked by head and tail both.

30. Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai-jan,
    I should answer, Yes.  For the men of Wu and the men
    of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river
    in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come
    to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps the right.

31. Hence it is not enough to put one's trust
    in the tethering of horses, and the burying of chariot
    wheels in the ground

32. The principle on which to manage an army is to set
    up one standard of courage which all must reach.

33. How to make the best of both strong and weak--that
    is a question involving the proper use of ground.

34. Thus the skillful general conducts his army just
    as though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by
    the hand.

35. It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus
    ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.

36. He must be able to mystify his officers and men
    by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them
    in total ignorance.

37. By altering his arrangements and changing
    his plans, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge. 
    By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes,
    he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose.

38. At the critical moment, the leader of an army
    acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks
    away the ladder behind him.  He carries his men deep
    into hostile territory before he shows his hand.

39. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots;
    like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives
    his men this way and that, and nothing knows whither he
    is going.

40. To muster his host and bring it into danger:--this
    may be termed the business of the general.

41. The different measures suited to the nine
    varieties of ground; the expediency of aggressive or
    defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: 
    these are things that must most certainly be studied.

42. When invading hostile territory, the general
    principle is, that penetrating deeply brings cohesion;
    penetrating but a short way means dispersion.

43. When you leave your own country behind, and take
    your army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself
    on critical ground.  When there are means of communication
    on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways.

44. When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is
    serious ground.  When you penetrate but a little way,
    it is facile ground.

45. When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear,
    and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground. 
    When there is no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.

46. Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire
    my men with unity of purpose.  On facile ground, I would
    see that there is close connection between all parts
    of my army.

47. On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.

48. On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye
    on my defenses.  On ground of intersecting highways,
    I would consolidate my alliances.

49. On serious ground, I would try to ensure
    a continuous stream of supplies.  On difficult ground,
    I would keep pushing on along the road.

50. On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way
    of retreat.  On desperate ground, I would proclaim
    to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives.

51. For it is the soldier's disposition to offer
    an obstinate resistance when surrounded, to fight hard
    when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he
    has fallen into danger.

52. We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring
    princes until we are acquainted with their designs.  We are
    not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar
    with the face of the country--its mountains and forests,
    its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. 
    We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account
    unless we make use of local guides.

53. To be ignored of any one of the following four
    or five principles does not befit a warlike prince.

54. When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state,
    his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration
    of the enemy's forces.  He overawes his opponents,
    and their allies are prevented from joining against him.

55. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all
    and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states. 
    He carries out his own secret designs, keeping his
    antagonists in awe.  Thus he is able to capture their
    cities and overthrow their kingdoms.

56. Bestow rewards without regard to rule,
    issue orders without regard to previous arrangements;
    and you will be able to handle a whole army as though
    you had to do with but a single man.

57. Confront your soldiers with the deed itself;
    never let them know your design.  When the outlook is bright,
    bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when
    the situation is gloomy.

58. Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive;
    plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off
    in safety.

59. For it is precisely when a force has fallen into
    harm's way that is capable of striking a blow for victory.

60. Success in warfare is gained by carefully
    accommodating ourselves to the enemy's purpose.

61. By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank, we shall
    succeed in the long run in killing the commander-in-chief.

62. This is called ability to accomplish a thing
    by sheer cunning.

63. On the day that you take up your command,
    block the frontier passes, destroy the official tallies,
    and stop the passage of all emissaries.

64. Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you
    may control the situation.

65. If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.

66. Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear,
    and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.

67. Walk in the path defined by rule, and accommodate
    yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle.

68. At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden,
    until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate
    the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late
    for the enemy to oppose you.


XII. THE ATTACK BY FIRE


 1. Sun Tzu said:  There are five ways of attacking
    with fire.  The first is to burn soldiers in their camp;
    the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn
    baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines;
    the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.

 2. In order to carry out an attack, we must have
    means available.  The material for raising fire should
    always be kept in readiness.

 3. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire,
    and special days for starting a conflagration.

 4. The proper season is when the weather is very dry;
    the special days are those when the moon is in the
    constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing
    or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.

 5. In attacking with fire, one should be prepared
    to meet five possible developments:

 6. (1) When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp,
    respond at once with an attack from without.

 7. (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's
    soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.

 8. (3) When the force of the flames has reached its height,
    follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable;
    if not, stay where you are.

 9. (4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire
    from without, do not wait for it to break out within,
    but deliver your attack at a favorable moment.

10. (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. 
    Do not attack from the leeward.

11. A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long,
    but a night breeze soon falls.

12. In every army, the five developments connected with
    fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated,
    and a watch kept for the proper days.

13. Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence;
    those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.

14. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted,
    but not robbed of all his belongings.

15. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his
    battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating
    the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time
    and general stagnation.

16. Hence the saying:  The enlightened ruler lays his
    plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.

17. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not
    your troops unless there is something to be gained;
    fight not unless the position is critical.

18. No ruler should put troops into the field merely
    to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight
    a battle simply out of pique.

19. If it is to your advantage, make a forward move;
    if not, stay where you are.

20. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may
    be succeeded by content.

21. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can
    never come again into being; nor can the dead ever
    be brought back to life.

22. Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful,
    and the good general full of caution.  This is the way
    to keep a country at peace and an army intact.


XIII. THE USE OF SPIES


 1. Sun Tzu said:  Raising a host of a hundred thousand
    men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss
    on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. 
    The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces
    of silver.  There will be commotion at home and abroad,
    and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. 
    As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded
    in their labor.

 2. Hostile armies may face each other for years,
    striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. 
    This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's
    condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred
    ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height
    of inhumanity.

 3. One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present
    help to his sovereign, no master of victory.

 4. Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good
    general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond
    the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.

 5. Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits;
    it cannot be obtained inductively from experience,
    nor by any deductive calculation.

 6. Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only
    be obtained from other men.

 7. Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: 
    (1) Local spies; (2) inward spies; (3) converted spies;
    (4) doomed spies; (5) surviving spies.

 8. When these five kinds of spy are all at work,
    none can discover the secret system.  This is called "divine
    manipulation of the threads."  It is the sovereign's
    most precious faculty.

 9. Having local spies means employing the services
    of the inhabitants of a district.

10. Having inward spies, making use of officials
    of the enemy.

11. Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's
    spies and using them for our own purposes.

12. Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly
    for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know
    of them and report them to the enemy.

13. Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring
    back news from the enemy's camp.

14. Hence it is that which none in the whole army are
    more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. 
    None should be more liberally rewarded.  In no other
    business should greater secrecy be preserved.

15. Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain
    intuitive sagacity.

16. They cannot be properly managed without benevolence
    and straightforwardness.

17. Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make
    certain of the truth of their reports.

18. Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every
    kind of business.

19. If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy
    before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together
    with the man to whom the secret was told.

20. Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm
    a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always
    necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants,
    the aides-de-camp, and door-keepers and sentries of the general
    in command.  Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.

21. The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us
    must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and
    comfortably housed.  Thus they will become converted
    spies and available for our service.

22. It is through the information brought by the
    converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ
    local and inward spies.

23. It is owing to his information, again, that we can
    cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.

24. Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving
    spy can be used on appointed occasions.

25. The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties
    is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only
    be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. 
    Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated
    with the utmost liberality.

26. Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to I
    Chih who had served under the Hsia.  Likewise, the rise
    of the Chou dynasty was due to Lu Ya who had served
    under the Yin.

27. Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the
    wise general who will use the highest intelligence of
    the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve
    great results.  Spies are a most important element in water,
    because on them depends an army's ability to move.


[END - Sun Tzu on the Art of War, text-only]



An atheist was taking a walk through the woods, admiring all that the
accident of evolution had created.

"What majestic trees! What powerful rivers! What beautiful animals!" he
said to himself. As he walked alongside the river he heard a rustling
in the bushes behind him.

He turned to look.

A 7-foot grizzly was charging towards him. He ran as fast as he could
up the path. He looked over his shoulder and the bear was closing in.
He ran even faster, so scared that tears were coming to his eyes. He
looked over his shoulder, and the bear was even closer. His heart
pumped frantically and he tried to run even faster. He tripped and fell
on the ground.

He rolled over to pick himself up and the bear, right on top of him,
reached for him with his left paw and raising his right paw to strike
him.

At that instant the Atheist cried out "Oh my God! ... "
Time stopped.
The bear froze.
The forest was silent.
Even the river stopped moving.

As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky: "You
deny my existence for all of these years, teach others I don't exist,
and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. Do you expect me to help
you out of this predicament? Am I to count you as a believer?"

The atheist looked directly into the light: "It would be hypocritical
to ask to be a Christian after all these years, but perhaps could you
make the bear a Christian?"

"Very well," said the voice.
The light went out.
The river ran again.
And the sounds of the forest resumed.

The bear dropped his right paw ... brought both paws together ... bowed
his head: "Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly
thankful."

This is off topic, it's definitely tasteless, but too serious for
a.t.j.  Should be on a.t. where this message is x-posted.  Please trim
your headers and post follow-ups in alt.tasteless.

For some time I have been searching the net fot this to no avail.  So,
since someone else remembers it,  here's some of it!  I expect to get
a lot of additional verses because this has cost me a lot of pain! (a)
from retyping it from an old hardcopy and (b) from having a good
laugh.  The fucker gets archived from now on!

 If the typing is inacurate or you don't like the piss-poor Brit
spelling and doubtful punctuation, well fuck you!


The official alt.tasteless theme song

Credit: Crunchy Frog

Boogers and squicking and really gross habits,
Taking lawn mowers and running down rabbits,
Grinding a few slugs to death 'neath my boots.
These are a few of my favourite pursuits.

Photos of faeces and samples of farting.
The sight of the squeamish folks quickly departing.
Castrating yourself with a small loop of string.
These are the things that alt.tastless will bring.

When I piss blood, when I blow chucks
When I'm feeling sad...
I simply tune in to a certain newsgroup,
And I don't feel so bad.

Fucking cadavers and licking their snatches,
Burning your gonads with several matches.
"I like to blow sheepdogs.  Please, am I okay?"
Alt.tasteless provides this for free every day!

If it's nasty and unpleasant
If it's really vile...
It can be found here, on this humble news group
(We just like to make you smile).

Dicks that are stolen and placed in girls' handbags,
Feco-stalagmites and crusty old snotrags,
Kittens by motorbikes ground to a paste,
All evoke images too good to waste.

Super-glued condoms with ground glass and fish hooks,
Flatulent recipes, new road kill cookbooks,
Ovine pudenda with mucus bedewed:
These are our stories, both tasteless and rude!

When my fiends say "That's disgusting"!
I know right away,
The folks in this newsgroup won't turn me away.
Alt.tasteless, you make my day!

Credit:  Kevin Skelm

Peeled babies sucked dry by thousands of leeches,
AIDS-ridden garbage on North Eastern beaches,
Suck fuckers piercing their dicks with steel rings...
These are a few of my favourite things!

Credit:  Richard Barry Ling

Toilet bowls clogged up with soft slimly faeces,
Guys giving head jobs to various species,
Dead cats on roadsides, to name but a few - 
These are the things that make me want to spew!

Bubbling loogies of curling green mucus,
Stories of vomitors, retchers and pukers,
Chickens all trussed up with tape round their wings - 
These are a few of my favourite things!

Big balls of snot roasting slowly on spits,
Blood and pus oozing like toothpaste from zits,
Mould filled vaginas and foetus dissection
These are the things that give me an erection!

Old dried up earthworms lying rotting in drains,
Rat's heads exploding when attached to the mains.
Six metre stalactites made from dried crap - 
Please pass a bucket, I'm about to throw up...

Hawks ripping rabbits to shreds with their talons.
Fat slags with pussies that hold seven gallons.
Dark hairy armpits and hot blowfly soup -
Such are the thighs that you'll read in this group.

Farts which just make the tears flow from your eyes,
Tits which hang right down to cellulite thighs,
Open heart surgery, digs cut in half -
Now please excuse me, I'm going to barf.

Credit:  Dave Rhubhymen

Squicking new-born babies with my beastly penis,
Blood sucking bastards with huge genital penis's,
Posting great GIF's of females with dicks,
These are a few of my favourite things!

Credit:  Danniel J. Blumenfeld

Stories about pets eating shards of ground glass,
Sticking explosives up a cat's inflamed arse.
Recipes for chunky cream of shit stew.
Delivered from a.t. directly to you.

Dining on road-kill from wide studded tyres,
Burning the genitals with Nichrome wires,
Condensing one's farts with liquid nitrogen.
Posted on a.t. again and again.

How to make head cheese with two-week old jism,
Tasteless jokes made at and cataclysm,
Death of small children in hilarious ways.
You could read a.t. endlessly for days.

Fermented stench of yeast-infected pussies,
Green slimly turdlets from baby's raw tushies,
Talk of bodily fluids incredibly vile.
It's better than sex, so read a.t. awhile.

Giving enemas made with chilli powder,
The etiquette of serving chilled maggot chowder.
Comments and critiques amuse and appal,
This forum of tastelessness will reveal all.

Mutilating scrota of yapping poodles,
Baking used tampons into cherry strudels,
Porking pus-filled eyes of the dead.
Reading A.t. is like getting good head.

When you want to
Be so sickened
That you'll need to hurl.
Just tap into a.t. and read all the posts, and experience gross-out
world

Credit:  Phineas Narco

Bright copper kettles and warm woollen mittens,
Disembowelled babies and dismembered kittens,
Brown paper letter bombs tied up with string,
These are a few of my favourite things.

Girls with white dresses with blue satin sashes,
I love to whip them with long leather lashes.
Serial killers who do nasty things,
These are a few of my favourite things.

Priests, nuns and school girls cut up in pieces,
Car crashes, throat slashes, deadly diseases,
Overturned cop cars and needles that sting.
These are a few of my favourite things.

When I', bored and feeling rotten,
When I'm feeling sad,
I think of a few of my favourite things
And then I go completely mad!

Credit:  Geoff Miller


When I get the leisure, I will retype the alternative a.t. theme song
which runs to the tune of 'Things that remind me of you'.    AND.....
the Tasteless Alphabet for Kids.

1. Introduction

Greetings and welcome to what used to be the funniest place on the
Internet. Unfortunately, through lack of proper use atj is not what it
used
to be. Please read this FAQ if you are a newcomer to the group or if you
think it's okay to flame (racists, England, Minnesota, USA, Joe Kohn,
John
Griffin, etc.) without writing a joke.

If you don't feel like reading this entire faq, please remember the
following statement:

*** DON'T POST TO THE NEWSGROUP WITHOUT INCLUDING A JOKE ***

As long as you always abide by this, and others do the same, this
newsgroup
will be a much more rewarding endeavor for everyone.

3. Safe Use of atj - a note for newbies

So you are a new participant in this newsgroup, eh? Well, I hope you
have
your asbestos suit handy--because, regardless of what folks say, atj is
a
mine field for new members. The people who read this group are not very
patient with silly mistakes, and are not very restrained in going about
flaming them. This place is not for the weak of spirit...

That being said, if you go over this FAQ carefully, your chances of
posting
unburned will be significantly higher. And just remember: if there's one
thing this newsgroup needs, it's new blood, newbies with new jokes. So,
regardless of the result, if you are posting new material to atj, your
work
will be appreciated by the (probably silent) majority.

Good luck.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Hi. I don't want to read this whole long faq. Got any quick advice
for
me?

A: Yes. Don't post anything to this newsgroup without including a
tasteless
joke along with it. That's the most important thing I can tell you.

Q: I see the description of this newsgroup is "sometimes disgusting
rather
than tasteless or funny." Does that mean it's proper to post stuff that
is
just plain disgusting, even if it's not funny?

A: No. The description was written that way because too many folks post
useless junk instead of tasteless jokes. If everyone posted appropriate
material to this newsgroup, that description would no longer apply.
Let's
all work towards this end. Please post only tasteless jokes here.

Q: Hi, I'm not interested in what this group's about, I'm just testing
my
news gateway here, sorry about that, only be a minute-

A: There are places for testing your net connection. This is not one of
them. Neither is any other newsgroup not named alt.test. Please take
your
tests there.

Q: Hey, I found this *great* document entitled "MAKE MONEY FAST" written
by
this visionary named Dave Rhodes that I'd like to show to all you guys-

A: Please don't. MAKE MONEY FAST (as well as it's many derivatives such
as
QUICKCASH!!!) are shams and are guaranteed to make everyone on the net
hate
you. It is unlikely to make you any money, the whole process is of
dubious
legality, and Dave Rhodes is in jail.

Q: I like humor, but I don't want to be offended. Is alt.tasteless.jokes
for me?

A: No. Why don't you go to rec.humor.funny (a moderated newsgroup
guaranteed to be unoffensive) or rec.funny (which is probably a safer
bet
for the thin-skinned)?

Q: I saw a joke that I liked, and I have a somewhat related joke that I
would like to post under the same thread. How should I go about doing
this?

A: Just go about your business using common sense. If it was a long
story
joke that you read, and you want to post a joke relating to it, you
probably do not need to copy the whole joke into your reply. This is
especially inappropriate if you post a one-liner after a five paragraph
story joke. This wastes time, wastes money, and is generally a good way
to
get yourself flamed.

Q: I saw a joke that I liked. I'd like to tell the poster so. What is
the
accepted way of doing this?

A: It's always better to do these things via email. Consider that the
person who you wish to congratulate might not get on this newsgroup very
often, and consider that most of the other people around here probably
are
not very interested in what you have to say, and the best course of
action
should be clear to you.

Q: I saw a joke that just was not funny. It bothered me because it made
reference to (Hitler, Jews, whites, blacks, homosexuals, etc.) in a
desparaging manner. What can I do about this?

A: Good question. A general rule of thumb in this situation is that no
one
cares what you think. If you post to the net with a flame of this joke,
you
waste bandwidth and all you are doing is pissing other people off. If a
joke is not funny, just let it die in peace. If you have a good sense of
humor, and have correctly gauged the joke's value, it will disappear
quickly. If not, you, and not the poster, may be the one with the
problem.

Q: That's not good enough. I want to let this person know that I do not
appreciate the joke and possibly shame him/her into refraining from
posting
in the future. What do I do now?

A: It's always good to have such dedication on this group - keeps us
strong. If you feel the need to flame the poster of this joke, by all
means
do it. Hey, it's a free world, right? But bandwidth is very expensive so
if
you need to flame please do it by email if at all possible.

Q: It's not possible. I want to tell the world what I think. I'm posting
on
the net and if you don't like it then screw off, okay?

A: I was afraid it would get to this point. If you need to post a flame
for
everyone to see and appreciate (and I have seen some flames that qualify
as
being meterial that I appreciate) then post a joke with it. That's what
the
'objoke' means on all of these posts around here. Were this newsgroup
used
correctly there would be at least one joke in every post. So if you've
got
a complaint that you want the world to hear, include a joke that you
want
the world to hear and you will be much more appreciated.

Q: Okay, how about this (Zeke, bigtex, et. al.) guy? He really pisses me
off every time he posts - and he posts a lot. How do I get him to stop?
Flame every one of his posts?

A: It's called a killfile. Look into it.

Q: I saw a joke that was very insensitive to the struggles of (insert
minority here). Isn't that illegal?

A: Look. Can you read the name of this group? Here, let me help you -
alt.tasteless.jokes. When you read a joke about blacks, or chicanos, or
mathematicians, what you are reading is the epitome of tastelessness,
i.e.
judging a group of people based on stereotypes. My advice to you would
be
deal with it. I guarantee that for every one of you who is offended, a
bunch of tasteless people found the joke very funny. So shut yer yap. I
have seen many a joke that I should have found offensive because they
dealt
with white folks. But Whitey jokes do not bother me at all because I
don't
take this newsgroup too seriously like some other people seem to.
Remember
who you are dealing with here: not alt.sensitivity, alt.save.the.earth,
alt.save.the.whales., or alt.inner.child. The people who post here are
often crude, obnoxious and unpresentable in public. Hence the term
tasteless in the newsgroup title. If you are offended by a joke then
perhaps you are in the wrong place.

And no, it's not illegal to post such a joke.

These four gents go out to play golf one sunny morning. One is detained
in
the clubhouse, and the other three are discussing their children while
walking to the first tee.

My son," says one, "has made quite a name for himself in the
home-building
industry. He began as a carpenter, but now owns his own design and
construction firm. He's so successful in fact, in the last year he was
able
to give a good friend a brand new home as a gift."

The second man, not to be outdone, allows how his son began his career
as a
car salesman, but now owns a multi-line dealership. He's so successful,
in
fact, in the last six months he gave a friend two brand new cars as a
gift."

The third man's son has worked his way up through a stock brokerage and
in
the last few weeks has given a good friend a large stock portfolio as a
gift.

As the fourth man arrives at the tee box, another tells him that they
have
been discussing their progeny and asks what line his son is in. "To tell
the truth, I'm not very pleased with how my son has turned out, he
replies.
"For fifteen years, he's been a hairdresser, and I've just recently
discovered he's a practicing homosexual. But, on the bright side, he
must
be good at what he does because his last three boyfriends have given him
a
brand new house, two cars, and a big pile of stock certificates."

Subject: A very long rant

What it feels like to have dog shit crammed down your throat.

Once upon a time I had an ATM card from Chase Manhattan Bank. But then 
Chase, without consulting me, sent me a _new_ and _better_ card: an ATM 
card disguised as a MasterCard credit card! A debit card! Yes!

No!

I don't want a debit card. I don't need a debit card. My credit rating benefits
Not At All from a fake credit card. I have perfectly good credit cards. JUST 
GIVE ME MY DAMN ATM BANK CARD WITH NO OTHER LOGOS ON IT, PLEASE. Please.

So I just ignored the card, cut it up, threw it away, continued to use my 
"classic" ATM card. So did James.

But! Because we did not call up and activate and then cancel the debit card, 
thus marking our account as one preferring to receive the "classic" card at 
renewal time--at renewal time, when our cards expired, WE RECEIVED 
NO CARD AT ALL. What a great system!

So I called. I bitched. They said, gee, you should have called and 
activated/canceled that debit card, then you would have automatically gotten 
your classic card on time. Here, let us fix your account, they said. Now 
we'll send you a new classic card, and henceforth (they said) you will only 
receive classic cards at renewal time.

Well, when hubby's card expired he had to go through the same hoops to get 
his new classic card. But here's the twist: when *I* canceled/renewed my 
card, his portion of the account remained untouched (he would have to call 
up himself). But when _he_ canceled/renewed _his_ card, why golly 
gee! The teller decided that MY CARD ought to be canceled and renewed 
again too! After all, hubby IS a MAN. Never mind that *I* am the primary 
account holder and he the joint holder. Oh no! If the husband cancels his 
card--the little wifey gets zapped too! This would not have been as deeply 
humiliating, but I was on vacation at the time, with Nina. Yes, that's right. 
I was 7.5 hours from home with an 11.5 week old child and cut off from my 
bank account.

Brilliant.

So I called. I bitched. It was a very long conversation, and I spoke with a 
Manager. They said, gee, we don't know how that happened. But hey, a 
new card is being mailed to you! But I'm not at home you morons! I yelled. 
Well, okay. Go to your nearest branch and pick up a *temporary* card. In 
the meantime, (they said), we'll cancel that card that's in the mail to you 
(we have to, in order to issue a temporary!!) and mail another one! Why, I 
said, can't you just REACTIVATE the card I have? We're talking a 
KEYSTROKE here, folks, I said. No, no! they said. It just can't be done. 
Security reasons, y'know. Security my white zitty butt. Bad programming 
is more like it.

I went to the nearest branch. I requested a temporary card. The bank 
manager called up my information on her computer. Oh, you lost your card? 
she said. NO, I panted, it was CANCELED in SEXIST ERROR. Oh, she 
said. It says here in the system that you lost it. This, after a twenty-
minute, manager-involved call. Well, I'll be dipped in shit, I muttered 
under my breath. And I took my temporary card and skedaddled.

Back home from vacation, I cut up my first new classic ATM card. I cut up 
the second classic card. I cut up the temporary card. And I put the third-
issued classic card in my wallet (after determining that it indeed worked). I 
thought perhaps it would all end there.

But no.

Today, in the mail.

A MasterCard ATM card, in my name, with a sticker on it--Call To Activate!

Aie.

So I called. I bitched.  I said, I'm on my fourth ATM card in a month. What 
about this scenario still isn't clear to you folks? What do I have to do? 
Well, they said, you have to activate/cancel the MasterCard card. But, I said, 
won't that deactivate my current NEW classic card? Oh, yes, they said. 
That's how it works. Then we'll send you a new classic ATM card in the 
mail......

I've had nicer recurring nightmares than this.

What, I said, is to prevent you from sending me another one of these 
damned debit cards in the future? Well, they said, once you order a classic 
card, your account will be marked as such, and you will only receive classic 
cards in the future.

Now, where have I heard THAT ONE before?

Walter V. Shipley

That's his name. That's his address. Until today, I wasn't going to send 
him a letter. Really, I wasn't. I was going to let bygones be bygones. But 
now? Oh Ho!

   A SHORT HISTORY OF THE AFL
   --------------------------

The game of Aussie Rules was first played in 1858 by two of the private schools
in Melbourne. The original game consisted of 40 players and the field was 1 mile
long. The first to score won the match. Of course this took too long so the game
was quickly refined to something very similar to today's game. In 1859 the first
club game took place between the Geelong and Melbourne football clubs. Then most
clubs were run on a voluntary committee basis, or as a club for people to join
as they please. Now most of the clubs are companies and shares can be purchased
in each team. There is no real private ownership here (it was tried but it
failed as it is not really profitable).

Anyway, after this first games other clubs were formed from various regions
close to Melbourne. Originally these clubs were offshoots from cricket clubs and
the game was used to keep cricketers fit during the winter months. Some of the
teams that were formed in those early days were:
        Carlton (formed 1864)
        Collingwood (1892)
        Essendon (1873)
        Fitzroy (1884)
        Geelong (1859)
        Melbourne (1858)
        South Melbourne (1874) (now the Sydney Swans)
        St. Kilda (1873)

In 1877 most of these teams as well as others from around Melbourne formed an
association called the Victorian Footbal Association (VFA). This association
still exists today but it is of a lower standard than the AFL. By 1896 the
management of the VFA was becoming autocratic and so Collingwood, Essendon,
Fitzroy, Geelong, Melbourne, and South Melbourne met in 1896 and decided to form
a breakaway league called the Victorian Football League (VFL). They also invited
Carlton and St.Kilda (as they were the richest clubs). In 1897 the VFL first
played its games. The first premiership was won by Essendon. St.Kilda finally
won its first game in Round 1, 1900 after 48 consecutive losses (I told you they
were only there because they were rich).

    Premierships (1897-1907):
    ------------------------
    1897 Essendon   (no grand final)
    1898 Fitzroy        (38)  d. Essendon        (23)
    1899 Fitzroy        (27)  d. South Melbourne (26)
    1900 Melbourne      (34)  d. Fitzroy         (30)
    1901 Essendon       (43)  d. Collingwood     (16)
    1902 Collingwood    (60)  d. Essendon        (27)
    1903 Collingwood    (31)  d. Fitzroy         (29)
    1904 Fitzroy        (61)  d. Carlton         (37)
    1905 Fitzroy        (72)  d. Carlton         (45)
    1906 Carlton        (94)  d. Fitzroy         (45)
    1907 Carlton        (50)  d. South Melbourne (45)

The VFL had grown greatly in its first years. From only 3000 people watching
the first finals matches, the crowds had grown to 45000 watching the 1907 grand
final. As such there was pressure for more games to be played. More teams had
to be admitted so the league took applications from clubs. In 1908 University
(formed 1866 from Melboure University) and Richmond (1885) joined. North
Melbourne was told to wait for another place to open (in 17 years time).

    Premierships (1908-1914):
    ------------------------
    1908 Carlton        (35)  d. Essendon        (26)
    1909 South Melbourne(38)  d. Carlton         (36)
    1910 Collingwood    (61)  d. Carlton         (47)
    1911 Essendon       (41)  d. Collingwood     (35)
    1912 Essendon       (47)  d. South Melbourne (33) (rec. attendance 54,463)
    1913 Fitzroy        (56)  d. St.Kilda        (43) (rec. attendance 59,479)
    1914 Carlton        (45)  d. South Melbourne (39)

In 1915 the war came and clubs began disbanding due to the shortage of players.
University disbanded in 1915 and was never to enter league ranks again. In 1916,
Essendon (rejoined 1918), Geelong (1917), Melbourne (1919), South Melbourne
(1917) and St.Kilda (1918) were forced into recess.

In the pre-war years of the VFL the scores were very low. Place-kicks were used
(a la rugby and american football) when shooting for goal and this slowed the
game. After the war, scores increased with the decreased use of the place-kick,
the penalisation of kicking the ball out of bounds and a general greater profic-
iency of the game eventually lead to regular record high scores in the 1930's.

    Premierships (1915-1924):
    ------------------------
    1915 Carlton        (78)  d. Collingwood     (45)
    1916 Fitzroy        (85)  d. Carlton         (56)
    1917 Collingwood    (74)  d. Fitzroy         (39)
    1918 South Melbourne(62)  d. Collingwood     (57)
    1919 Collingwood    (78)  d. Richmond        (53)
    1920 Richmond       (52)  d. Collingwood     (35)
    1921 Richmond       (36)  d. Carlton         (32)
    1922 Fitzroy        (79)  d. Collingwood     (68)
    1923 Essendon       (63)  d. Fitzroy         (46)
    1924 Essendon     (no final played)

In 1925 crowds once again were getting substantially bigger. The league decided
to expand to 12 clubs. They received applications from many clubs in the VFA
but they decided to chose North Melbourne, Hawthorn, and Footscray. The league
stayed with these twelve teams until 1982 when South Melbourne moved to Sydney.

To understand where all these teams come from, here is a map of Melbourne and
the suburbs which the clubs are named after. Geelong is a city about 50 miles
South West of Melbourne.

The teams had a great rivalry between them. The rivalry had two causes: a close
proximity to each other, or close and hard fought games. The oldest rivalry in
the VFL was between Carlton and Collingwood. This was mainly because Carlton
was the more affluent suburb, and Collingwood was the working-class suburb.
Other rivalries have been formed over the years, such as Melbourne and
Collingwood because they played 6 or 7 grand finals between each other in the
1950's. Other rivalries are Collingwood and Richmond, Carlton and Richmond,
Essendon and Carlton. For most Melbournites, the two teams you love to hate are
Carlton and Collingwood. This is also the case because they have won the most
premierships between them.

 Geelong finally won their first flag in 1925 but amazingly they lost their
first game of the year to newcomer North Melbourne. All three new teams in 1925
were in the bottom three with Hawthorn coming last. This was also the case in
1926 and 1927. Hawthorn came last in 1925, 1927, 1928, and 1932. North Melbourne
came last in all the other years until 1935 except for one. It wasn't until
round 2 of the 1938 season that all three teams won a game on the same day!

 Collingwood began their unparalleled record in 1927 of four premierships in a
row. They won the flag in 1928 with an unbeaten regular season and only lost the
second-semi final to Richmond who they beat in the Grand Final. In fact they
defeated Richmond in three of the four premierships. Some of Collingwood's
greatest legends played in this era. Gordon Coventry played over 300 games for
the club, the first player in the VFL to do so. He also has the record aggregate
goals with 1299 for his career. Collingwood was also coached in this period by
the great Jock McHale. McHale was associated with Collingwood from 1903 and
coached the club for 37 years from 1913 to 1949. He took the club to 20 Grand
Finals and won 8 premierships. Other great names in this period were Syd
Coventry, Harry Collier and Albert Collier.

 Some changes occurred in the game around this game. In 1930 a reserve was
introduced. The reserve was known as the 19th man as there are 18 men in a team.
The reserves changed in the same manner as a soccer reserve. In 1931 the finals
system was changed to the 'Final Four' system. This system was retained until
1970 when there was a 'Final Five'. The previous 'Argus' system allowed the team
that finished on top of the ladder to challenge a re-match if they lost the
final! amongst other anomailes.

 The 1930's saw the continuing strength of Richmond, Geelong, Collingwood and
Carlton but the surprise was South Melbourne. South won the first 10 games of
the 1932 season but then their luck ran out. They finished with a 13-5 record
that season and lost their finals match, but the next year they won the flag.
In 1934 their star goal kicker Bob Pratt broke the season goal-kicking record
to kick 150 goals in 21 games, a record only equalled by Hawthorn's Peter Hudson
in 1970. Even though South was the first team to score over 2000 points in an
18 game season they still lost the Grand Final. In fact they also lost the next
two.

 Fitzroy and Essendon had an amazing run in the Brownlow Medal during this
period. They won every Brownlow medal between 1931 to 1938, Fitzroy winning 5 of
the 8. The main winners were two great players of the day, Haydn Bunton of
Fitzroy and Dick Reynolds of Essendon. The each won 6 of the 8 Brownlow Medals
in this period. The list of Brownlow medal winners until 1939 are:

                1924    E. 'Craji' Greeves      Geelong
                1925    Colin Watson            St.Kilda
                1926    Ivor Warne Smith        Melbourne
                1927    Syd Coventry            Collingwood
                1928    Ivor Warne Smith        Melbourne
                1929    Albert Collier          Collingwood
                1930    Harry Collier           Collingwood
                        Stan Judkins            Richmond
                        Allan Hopkins           Footscray
                1931    Haydn Bunton            Fitzroy
                1932    Haydn Bunton            Fitzroy
                1933    W. 'Chicken' Smallhorn  Fitzroy
                1934    Dick Reynolds           Essendon
                1935    Haydn Bunton            Fitzroy
                1936    Dinny Ryan              Fitzroy
                1937    Dick Reynolds           Essendon
                1938    Dick Reynolds           Essendon
                1939    Marcus Whelan           Collingwood

 The premierships between 1925 and 1939 went to:

    Premierships (1925-1939):
    -------------------------
    1925 Geelong        (79)  d. Collingwood     (69)
    1926 Melbourne     (119)  d. Collingwood     (62)
    1927 Collingwood    (25)  d. Richmond        (13)
    1928 Collingwood    (96)  d. Richmond        (63)
    1929 Collingwood    (79)  d. Richmond        (50)
    1930 Collingwood   (100)  d. Geelong         (70)
    1931 Geelong        (68)  d. Richmond        (48)
    1932 Richmond       (92)  d. Carlton         (83)
    1933 S. Melbourne   (71)  d. Richmond        (29)
    1934 Richmond      (128)  d. S. Melbourne    (89)
    1935 Collingwood    (78)  d. S. Melbourne    (58)
    1936 Collingwood    (89)  d. S. Melbourne    (78)
    1937 Geelong       (122)  d. Collingwood     (90)
    1938 Carlton       (100)  d. Collingwood     (85)
    1939 Melbourne     (148)  d. Collingwood     (95)

 The Grand Finals were regularly drawing crowds of between 60,000 and 80,000,
but the 1938 Grand Final drew a crowd of 96,834. In 1939, the Grand Final was
down because of war breaking out in Europe on September 1st.

 That is enough for now. I hope you have enjoyed this early history of the VFL.
I have not mentioned some of the other great names like Roy Cazaly of St.Kilda
and South Melbourne, Reg Hickey of Geelong, Jack Titus of Richmond, 'Soapy'
Valence of Carlton, and others but there isn't enough space. If you would like
to read more about the game, the book 'Every Game Ever Played' contains all
the scores from VFL/AFL matches up to the end of the 1992 season. I'll try to
write the post-war part soon.

  The following are copies of actual written statement collected form various
auto insurance companies in Northern and Southern California.  The drivers were
instructed to give a brief statement on the particulars of the accident in their
own words.
			  <(*******************)>

  Coming home I drove into the wrong house and collided with a tree I don't
have.  The other car collided with mine without giving warning of its
instructions.  I thought my window was down but I found out it was up when I put
my hand through it.

  I collided with a stationary truck coming the other way.

  A truck backed through my windshield into my wife's face.

  A pedestrian hit me and went under my car.

  The gut was all over the road.  I had to swerve a number of times before I hit
him.

  I was on my to the doctors with rear end trouble when my universal joint gave
way causing me to have an accident.

  As I approached the intersection a stop sign suddenly appeared at a place
where no stop sign had ever appeared before.  I was unable to avoid the
accident.  I told police that I wasn't injured, but upon removing my hat I found
that I had skull fracture.

  The other car attempted to cut in front of me so I, with my right bumper,
removed his left front tail light.

  I had been learning to drive with power steering.  I turned the wheel to what
I thought was enough room and found my self in a different direction going the
opposite way.

  I was thrown from my car as it left the road.  I was later found in a ditch by
some stray cows.

  I pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my mother in law and
headed over the embankment.

  The gentleman behind me struck me on the backside.  He then went to rest in
the bush with just his rear end showing.

  I had been shopping for plants all day and was on my way home.  As I reached
the intersection a hedge sprang up obscuring my vision.  I did not see the other
car.

  I had been driving my car for 40 years when I fell asleep at the wheel and had
the accident.

  The accident occurred when I was attempting to bring my car out of a skid by
steering it into the other vehicle.

  I was unable to stop in time and my car crashed into the other vehicle.  The
driver and passengers left immediately for a vacation with injuries.  An
invisible car came out of nowhere and struck my vehicle and vanished.  I saw the
slow moving, sad faced old man as he bounced off my car.  The indirect cause of
this accident was a little guy in a small car with a big mouth.

  I was backing my car out of the driveway in the usual manner, when it was
struck by the other car in the same place it had been struck several times
before.  In my attempt to kill a fly I drove into a telephone pole.  I thought I
could squeeze between two trucks when my car became squashed.  My car was
legally parked as it backed into the other vehicle.  The pedestrian had no idea
to go so I ran over him.  The telephone pole was approaching fast.  I was
attempting to swerve out of its path when it struck my front end.

  To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front of me I struck the pedestrian.
I was sure the old fellow would make it to the other side of the road when I
struck him.

  When I saw I could not avoid the collision, I stepped on the gas and crashed
into the other car.

  I was taking my canary to the hospital.  It got loose in the car and flew out
the window.  The next thing was his rear end and there was a crash.

	restitution from automobile insurance companies? It takes them that
	long to decipher what their clients are trying to tell them.

The story behind the letter below is that there is this nutcase in
Newport, Vermont named Scott Williams who digs things out of his back
yard and sends the stuff he finds to the Smithsonian Institution,
labelling them with scientific names, and insisting that they are
actual archaeological finds.

This guy really exists and does this in his spare time! Anyway, here's
the actual response from the Smithsonian Institution. Bear this in mind
next time you think you are challenged in your duty to respond to a
difficult situation in writing.
________________________________________________________________________


Smithsonian Institution
207 Pennsylvania Avenue
Washington, DC 20078

Dear Mr. Williams:

Thank you for your latest submission to the Institute, labelled
"93211-D, layer seven, next to the clothesline post... Hominid skull."

We have given this specimen a careful and detailed examination, and
regret to inform you that we disagree with your theory that it
represents conclusive proof of the presence of Early Man in Charleston
County two million years ago. Rather, it appears that what you have
found is the head of a Barbie doll, of the variety that one of our 
staff, who has small children, believes to be "Malibu Barbie."

It is evident that you have given a great deal of thought to the
analysis of this specimen, and you may be quite certain that those of
us who are familiar with your prior work in the field were loathe to
come to contradiction with your findings. However, we do feel that
there are a number of physical attributes of the specimen which might
have tipped you off to its modern origin:

1.   The material is moulded plastic. Ancient hominid remains are
     typically fossilised bone.
2.   The cranial capacity of the specimen is approximately 9 cubic
     centimetres, well below the threshold of even the earliest
     identified proto-hominids. 
3.   The dentition pattern evident on the skull is more consistent with
     the common domesticated dog than it is with the ravenous
     man-eating Plieocene clams you speculate roamed the wetlands
     during that time.

This latter finding is certainly one of the most intriguing hypotheses
you have submitted in your history with this institution, but the
evidence seems to weigh rather heavily against it. Without going into
too much detail, let us say that:

A.   The specimen looks like the head of a Barbie doll that a dog has
     chewed on.
B.   Clams don't have teeth.

It is with feelings tinged with melancholy that we must deny your
request to have the specimen carbon-dated. This is partially due to the
heavy load our lab must bear in its normal operation, and partly due to
carbon-dating's notorious inaccuracy in fossils of recent geologic
record. To the best of our knowledge, no Barbie dolls were produced
prior to 1956 AD, and carbon-dating is likely to produce wildly
inaccurate results.

Sadly, we must also deny your request that we approach the National
Science Foundation Phylogeny Department with the concept of assigning
your specimen the scientific name Australopithecus spiff-arino.
Speaking personally, I, for one, fought tenaciously for the acceptance
of your proposed taxonomy, but was ultimately voted down because the
species name you selected was hyphenated, and didn't really sound like
it might be Latin.

However, we gladly accept your generous donation of this fascinating
specimen to the museum. While it is undoubtedly not a Hominid fossil,
it is, nonetheless, yet another riveting example of the great body of
work you seem to accumulate here so effortlessly. You should know that
our Director has reserved a special shelf in his own office for the
display of the specimens you have previously submitted to the
Institution, and the entire staff speculates daily on what you will
happen upon next in your digs at the site you have discovered in your
Newport back yard.

We eagerly anticipate your trip to our nation's capital that you
proposed in your last letter, and several of us are pressing the
Director to pay for it. We are particularly interested in hearing you
expand on your theories surrounding the trans-positating fillifitation
of ferrous ions in a structural matrix that makes the excellent
juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex femur you recently discovered take on the
deceptive appearance of a rusty 9-mm Sears Craftsman automotive
crescent wrench.

Yours in Science,
Harvey Rowe
Chief Curator -Antiquities

He spoke with the wisdom that can only come from experience, like a guy who
went blind because he looked at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with
a pinhole in it and now goes around the country speaking at high schools about
the dangers of looking at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a
pinhole in it. Joseph Romm, Washington

She caught your eye like one of those pointy hook latches that used to dangle
from screen doors and would fly up whenever you banged the door open again.
Rich Murphy, Fairfax Station

The little boat gently drifted across the pond exactly the way a bowling ball
wouldn't. Russell Beland, Springfield

McBride fell 12 stories, hitting the pavement like a Hefty Bag filled with
vegetable soup. Paul Sabourin, Silver Spring

From the attic came an unearthly howl. The whole scene had an eerie, surreal
quality, like when you're on vacation in another city and "Jeopardy" comes on
at 7 p.m. instead of 7:30. Roy Ashley, Washington

Her hair glistened in the rain like nose hair after a sneeze. Chuck Smith,
Woodbridge

Her eyes were like two brown circles with big black dots in the center. Russell
Beland, Springfield

Bob was as perplexed as a hacker who means to access
T:flw.quid55328.com\aaakk/ch@ung but gets T:\flw.quidaaakk/ch@ung by mistake.
Ken Krattenmaker, Landover Hills

Her vocabulary was as bad as, like, whatever. Unknown

He was as tall as a six-foot-three-inch tree. Jack Bross, Chevy Chase

The hailstones leaped from the pavement, just like maggots when you fry them in
hot grease. Gary F. Hevel, Silver Spring

Her date was pleasant enough, but she knew that if her life was a movie this
guy would be buried in the credits as something like "Second Tall Man." Russell
Beland, Springfield

Long separated by cruel fate, the star-crossed lovers raced across the grassy
field toward each other like two freight trains, one having left Cleveland at
6:36 p.m. traveling at 55 mph, the other from Topeka at 4:19 p.m. at a speed of
35 mph. Jennifer Hart, Arlington

The politician was gone but unnoticed, like the period after the Dr. on a Dr
Pepper can. Wayne Goode, Madison, Ala.

They lived in a typical suburban neighborhood with picket fences that resembled
Nancy Kerrigan's teeth Paul Kocak, Syracuse, N.Y.

John and Mary had never met. They were like two hummingbirds who had also never
met. Russell Beland, Springfield

The thunder was ominous-sounding, much like the sound of a thin sheet of metal
being shaken backstage during the storm scene in a play. Barbara Fetherolf,
Alexandria

His thoughts tumbled in his head, making and breaking alliances like underpants
in a dryer without Cling Free Chuck Smith, Woodbridge

========

I had hoped that on arrival the weather would be performing
dramatically; that the buildings would be looming out of thick fog, or
that thunder and lightning would be battling in the sky. Or perhaps
that there would be uncharacteristicly clear and warm weather for the
time of year, with surreal blue skies and crisp shadows. Instead,
above me was the standard grey that there isn't a suitable metaphor
for; the kind of grey you expect in the first week. It was raining
slightly.

Flash forward to summer.

At two o'clock in the morning it is still quite hot. I can feel the
heat radiating off the concrete of the footpath beneath me and the
bricks of the wall on which I am sitting are keeping the backs of my
legs pleasantly warm too. I can see clearly, because my eyes have
adjusted to the darkness, but for someone turning off the well-lit
main road and onto the avenue it will seem very dark. Their
vision will be further impeded by the plane trees that line this
road. I am waiting for the right person to come past. I think I'll
know who it is when they arrive. I stroke the heavy piece of pipe on
the wall next to me. Surprisingly, it is quite cool to the touch.

A couple of men walk past, talking loudly to each other. They don't
notice me.

Time passes. The night has an almost metallic smell to it. I can hear
the trees growing.

I hear light, nervous footprints approaching, and I become alert. It
must be three o'clock by now. I would check my watch but it's too dark
to see the dial properly. I've chosen the part of the wall between the
two sodium lamps performing the most feeble impression of the sun
imaginable. I'm right; it is an undergraduate returning to college,
possibly from some late-night tryst. I pick the pipe up, and silence
my breathing.

I can taste blood in my mouth, so I reason that I must have bitten my
tongue in anticipation. It doesn't matter. My victim is close now.
Closer. Closest. I jump.

Hitting out with the pipe is like hitting a cushion so I hit and hit
and strike and strike and there is no noise but just the rushing of
blood in my ears and in my mouth and I keep hitting even though an
annoying little voice in my head is keeping a tally saying "twenty" so
this is why there "twenty-one" are so many stab wounds in knife
assaults "twenty-two" because it's so easy and I have to hit lower now
because she has fallen to the floor "twenty-three" and now it is time
for me to run so I run.

I'm back in my room and after washing the blood from the pipe and my
hands in the sink there doesn't seem to be anything better to do, so I
log on and read my e-mail.

I find that if I stare at the candle in my dimly lit room long enough,
I start to get tunnel vision. This is how I want to exist at the
moment; I want to feel that the end is closer now, and I want the
darkness to gather around me. Soon it will all be over. I take a last
glance at the keyboard in front of me, and prepare to type in the last
two sentences.

I swallow the final tablet in the bottle. It worries me to think that,
at the end of it all, it is quite possible that the only death I am
really responsible for is my own.

2. Spam

you wouldn't believe how much spam I get to this address.


========================================================================

3. Can you answer my awk question?

Probably not.  Please don't mail it to me.

Read the FAQ, and the materials pointed to by it, and if you can't find
an answer there, by all means post to the newsgroup.

A FAQ list is intended to reduce traffic on a newsgroup, not eliminate it.


========================================================================

4. How can I add a FAQ and its answer to the FAQ list?

Mail BOTH of them to me.  Then I can add them to the FAQ and it should
help people who have that same question later, as well as everyone who
reads the group, because they won't see it asked and answered so often.

I do not work on this FAQ every day, but I will try to get updates
incorporated in a timely manner.

  
========================================================================

5. What is awk?

awk is a programming language, named after its three original authors:

  Alfred V. Aho
  Brian W. Kernighan
  Peter J. Weinberger

they write:

``
  Awk is a convenient and expressive programming language that can be
  applied to a wide variety of computing and data-manipulation tasks.
''

the title of the book uses `AWK', but the contents of the book
use `awk' (except at the beginning of sentences, as above).  I
will attempt to do the same (except perhaps at the beginning of
sentences, as above).

most implementations of awk are interpreters which read your awk
source program and parse it and act on it directly.

some vendors have developed awk compilers which will produce an
`executable' that may be run stand-alone -- thus, the end user
does not have access to the source code.  there are also various
awk->C converters which allow you to achieve the same
functionality (by compiling the resulting C code later).

one of the most popular compilers, from Thompson Automation,
continues to be the subject of many positive posts in the group.

  [
    I don't really want to start a reviews section, but it may be
    appropriate.  I think it's of general interest, and a good thing
    for the FAQ, but I don't want to be given any grief by a negative
    review I didn't write just because I'm distributing it.

    if you have a review you'd like me to put a pointer to, please
    inform me -- I already have some pointers of this form listed.
  ]


========================================================================

6. What well-maintained awk-compatible languages are there?

  6.1 nawk
    AT&T's `new awk' -- probably nobody uses the `old awk' anymore.
    interpreter
    might NOT be well-maintained

  6.2 gawk
    from the GNU project
    interpreter

  6.3 mawk
    from Michael Brennan <mailto:brennan@whidbey.com>
    interpreter

  6.4 tawk
    from Thompson Automation
    interpreter
    compiler
    MS-Windows DLL

  6.5 mksawk
    interpreter
    compiler
    from Mortice Kern Systems

    an old version of mksawk is shipped as `nawk' on Ultrix and
    OSF/1.

  6.6 awkcc
    translator to C
    might NOT be well-maintained

  6.7 awk2c
    translator to C
    uses GNU awk libraries extensively, and is subject to GPL

  6.8 a2p
    translator to Perl
    comes with Perl
    doesn't handle multiple concatenations:  e.g., var="x" "y" "z"
      -> must be in pairs:  e.g.,  var=( "x" "y" ) "z"
    doesn't handle redirection:  e.g., { print("foo") > "bar" }
      -> no known workaround


========================================================================

7. Where can I buy awk?

7.1 AT&T (awk, awkcc)

  _The AWK Programming Language_ says:
    phone
      +1 201 522 6900 [is this number still valid?]

8. Where can I get awk for free?  For what platforms?

  8.0 meta-answer
    Obtaining Awk and Perl
    <http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~churchh/awk-perl.html>

  8.1 the one true awk
    <http://plan9.bell-labs.com/who/bwk/awk.sh>
    <ftp://netlib.bell-labs.com/netlib/research/awk.bundle.Z>

    This is the version of awk described in "The Awk Programming Language",
    by A. V. Aho, B. W. Kernighan, and P. J. Weinberger
    (Addison-Wesley, 1988, ISBN 0-201-07981-X).
    Changes, mostly bug fixes, are listed in FIXES.

  8.2 gawk
    NOTE:  gawk 3.0.2 has a per-record memory leak which is fixed
      in (the wide beta and later) of 3.0.3 .

    ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gawk*
    <ftp://ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/>
    e.g.,
      <ftp://ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gawk-3.0.2.tar.gz>

      8.2.1 gawk precompiled for MS-DOS, Win32, or OS/2

        The djgpp collection contains a 32-bit DOS gawk, along with
        many GNU utilities which may be useful with gawk (djgpp ports
        understand long filenames on Windows 95):

        <http://www.simtel.net/simtel.net/>
        <ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp>

  8.99 awkcc [unknown]
    previous versions of this FAQ mentioned a file on MKS' web site.
    Neil Mahoney spent some time examining it and discovered it is
    just a package BUILT with awkcc, not awkcc itself.  eventually,
    this notice will be removed.

some of Neil's explorations are interesting for those looking
for the real awkcc:

9. Why would anyone still use awk instead of perl?

  a valid question, since awk is a subset of perl.  however:

  - awk is simpler
  - you may already know awk well enough
  - you may already have only awk installed
  - awk can be smaller, thus much quicker to execute for small programs
  - awk variables don't have `$' in front of them :-)


========================================================================

10. How can I learn awk?

  The commercial vendors of DOS versions (MKS and Thompson) each have
  their own well written books with examples.  [available separately?]

  English Book:

      _The AWK Programming Language_, by Aho, Kernighan and Weinberger,
      who invented the language. Published by Addison-Wesley. Lots of
      good material in not a lot of space.  A little out of date
      with regard to POSIX awk.

      ISBN 0-201-07981-X

      <http://heg-school.aw.com/cseng/authors/aho/awk/awk.html>

  English Book:

      _Effective AWK Programming_ by Arnold Robbins.  Published by
      SSC (+1 206-FOR-UNIX, <http://www.ssc.com>,
      <mailto:sales@ssc.com>). Also published by the FSF as
      "The GNU AWK User's Guide"; Texinfo source is included with
      the gawk distribution, so you can also print this yourself.

      ISBN 0-916151-88-3

      Russell recommends buying the book instead of printing it all
      out, for three reasons:

        1. it's probably cheaper than using your own toner and paper.

        2. some money goes back to help further development, both to
           Arnold Robbins (only if you buy from SSC) and the Free
           Software Foundation (if you buy from either SSC or the FSF).

        3. it helps convince publishers that we _like_ having full
           documentation available on-line (e.g., for searching), but
           will still pay for a compact, bound copy

      information, including an errata list, is on the web site.

      <http://www.ssc.com/ssc/eap/>

  English Book:

      second edition:

      _Sed & Awk_, by Dale Dougherty & Arnold Robbins, published
      by O'Reilly and Associates.

      _sed & awk_ describes two text manipulation programs that are
      mainstays of the UNIX programmer's toolbox. This new edition
      covers the sed and awk programs as they are now mandated by
      the POSIX standard and includes discussion of the GNU versions
      of these programs.

      historical notes on the first edition:

      _Sed & Awk_, by Dale Dougherty, published by O'Reilly and
      Associates.  A nice introduction to sed and awk, showing how
      they relate to each other. However, the first edition is `full
      of typos and out-and-out mistakes'.

      <http://www.ora.com/catalog/sed/noframes.html>

      ISBN 0-937175-59-5

      a `by no means complete' errata list is available.
      the author mentions `later printings of the book have
      many of the errors fixed.'

12. How do I report a bug in gawk?

This is described in great detail in the gawk documentation. In brief,

   1. Make sure what you've discovered is really a bug by checking
      the documentation and, if possible, comparing with nawk and mawk.

   2. Cut down the program and data to as small as possible a test
      case that will illustrate the bug.

   3. Send mail to <mailto:bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu>, with a carbon
      copy to <mailto:arnold@gnu.ai.mit.edu>.

   4. Do not just post in comp.lang.awk; Arnold's readership there is
      sporadic.


========================================================================

13. What's wrong with gawk on Digital's OSF/1?

The version of gawk shipped with OSF/1 is very old, based on gawk
2.14. Get the current version from a GNU mirror near you, and if
you still have a problem, report it as per the directions in the
gawk documentation.


========================================================================

14. How can I access shell or environment variables in an awk script?

14.0 shells

the examples using quoting are intended for use with any standard
(sh-compatible-quoting) Unix shell.

non-sh-compatible shells will require different quoting.  if you're
not even using Unix (or a ported Unix shell), just ignore the whole
section on quoting.

14.1 Environment variables in general

Answer 1:  on Unix, use "alternate quoting", e.g.

        awk -F: '$1 ~ /'"$USER"'/ {print $5}' /etc/passwd
                ^^^^^^^^*******^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        any standard Unix shell will send the underlined part as one
        long argument (with embedded spaces) to awk, for instance:

        $1 ~ /bwk/ {print $5}

        Note that there may not be any spaces between the quoted
        parts.  Otherwise, you wouldn't end up a single, long script
        argument, because Unix shells break arguments on spaces
        (unless they are \d or in '' or "", as the example shows).

Answer 2:  RTFM to see if and how your awk supports variable definitions
           on the command line, e.g.,

        awk -F: -v name=$USER '$1 ~ name {print $5}' /etc/passwd

Answer 3:  RTFM if your awk can access enviroment vars.  Then perhaps

        awk -F: '$1 ~ ENVIRON["USER"] {print $5}' /etc/passwd

        Always remember for your /bin/sh scripts that it's easy to put
        things into the environment for a single command run:

        name=felix age=56 awk '... ENVIRON["name"] .....'

        this also works with ksh and some other shells.

The first approach is extremely portable, but doesn't work with
awk "-f" script files.  In that case, it's better to use a shell
script and stretch a long awk command argument in '...' across
multiple lines if need be.

Also note: /bin/csh requires a \ before an embedded newline, /bin/sh not.


14.2 Unix Shell Quoting

Quoting can be such a headache for the novice, in shell programming,
and especially in awk.

    (see below for a verbose explanation of the first one, with 7 quotes)

    awk 'BEGIN { q="'"'"'";print "Never say can"q"t."; exit }'
    nawk -v q="'" 'BEGIN { print "Never say can"q"t."; exit }'
    awk 'BEGIN { q=sprintf("%c",39); print "Never say can"q"t."; exit }'
    awk 'BEGIN { q=sprintf("%c",39); print "Never say \"can"q"t.\""; exit }'
    [Others?]

and

    cat <<@@ > foo.awk
    { print "Never say can't." }
    @@
    awk -f foo.awk; rm foo.awk

But not:

    awk '{ q="\'"; print "Never say \"can"q"t.\""; exit }'


explanation of the 7-quote example:

note that it is quoted three different ways:

    awk 'BEGIN { q="'
                     "'"
                        '";print "Never say can"q"t."; exit }'

and that argument comes out as the single string (with embedded spaces)

    BEGIN { q="'";print "Never say can"q"t."; exit }

which is the same as

    BEGIN { q="'"; print "Never say can" q "t."; exit }
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^  ^^
                          |           |  |  ||
                          |           |  |  ||
                          vvvvvvvvvvvvv  |  ||
                          Never say can  v  ||
                                         '  vv
                                            t.

which gets you

                          Never say can't.


14.3 ENVIRON[] and "env"|getline

   Modern versions of new awk (gawk, mawk, Bell Labs awk, any POSIX
   awk) all provide an array named ENVIRON.  The array is indexed by
   environment variable name, the value is that variables value.
   For instance, ENVIRON["HOME"] might be "/home/chris".  To print
   out all the names and values, use a simple loop:

        for (i in ENVIRON)
                printf("ENVIRON['%s'] = '%s'\n", i, ENVIRON[i])


   What if my awk doesn't have ENVIRON[]?

   Short answer, get a better awk. There are many freely available
   versions.

   Longer answer, on Unix you can use a pipe from the `env' or
   `printenv' commands, but this is less pretty, and may be a
   problem if the values contain newlines:

        # untested!
        while (("env" | getline line) > 0) {
                n = split(line, v, "=")
                # v[1] is variable name
                # v[2] is variable value
                if (n > 2)
                        # value contained "=", handle it ...
        }

14.4 exporting environment variables back to the parent process

   How can I put values into the environment of the program that
   called my awk program?

   Short answer, you can't.  Unix ain't Plan 9, and you can't tweak
   the parent's address space.

   DOS isn't even Unix, so it lets any program overwrite any memory
   location, including the parent's environment space.  But the
   details are (obviously) going to be fairly icky.  Avoid.

   Longer answer, write the results in a form the shell can parse
   to a temporary file, and have the shell "source" the file after
   running the awk program.

        awk 'BEGIN { printf("NEWVAR='%s'\n", somevalue) }' > /tmp/awk.$$
        . /tmp/awk.$$        # sh/ksh/bash/pdksh/zsh etc
        rm /tmp/awk.$$

   Csh syntax and more robust use of quotation marks are left as
   exercises for the reader.


========================================================================

15. Is there an easy way to determine if you have oawk or nawk?

The following in a BEGIN rule will do the trick.

        if (ARGC == 0)
                # old awk
        else
                # new awk


========================================================================

16. How does awk deal with multiple files?

  16.0 Version warning

    some of these techniques will require non-ancient versions of awk.

  16.1 How can awk test for the existence of a file?

The best way is to simply try and read from the file.

        function exists(file,        dummy, ret)
        {
                if ((getline dummy < file) > 0)
                        # file exists and can be read
                        ret = 1
                else
                        ret = 0
                close(file)
                return ret
        }

[ I've read reports that earlier versions of mawk would write to stderr
as well as getline returning <0 -- is this still true? ]

  16.2 How can I get awk to read multiple files?

    it's automatic -- use something like:

    awk '/^#include/ {print $2}' *.c *.h

  16.3 How can I tell from which file my input is coming?

    Use built-in variable FILENAME.

    awk '/^#include/ {print FILENAME,$2}' *.c *.h

  16.4 How can I get awk to open multiple files (selected at runtime)?

    use `getline', `close', and `print EXPR > FILENAME', like:

    function double(infilename,outfilename,    aline)
    {
      while ( (getline aline < infilename) >0 )
        print(aline aline) > outfilename;
      close(infilename);
      close(outilename);
    }

  16.5 How can I treat the first file specially?

    Use FILENAME, thusly:

    BEGIN { rulesfile="" }
    rulesfile == "" { rulesfile = FILENAME; }
    FILENAME == rulesfile { build_rule($0); }
    FILENAME != rulesfile { apply_rule($0); }

    Example:  

    Suppose you have a text-line "database" and you want to make some
    batch changes to it, by replacing some old lines with new lines.
 
    BEGIN { rulesfile="" }
    rulesfile == "" { rulesfile = FILENAME; }
    rulesfile == FILENAME { replace[$1] = $0; }
    rulesfile != FILENAME \
    { 
            if ($1 in replace) 
                    print replace[$1];
            else
                    print;
    }

  16.6 How can I explicitly pass in a filename to treat specially?

    use `-v rulesfile=filename' like you would any other variable,
    and then use a `getline' loop (and `close') in your BEGIN

        print "must use -v rulesfile=filename";
        exit(1);

17. How many elements were created by split()?

   when I do a split on a field, e.g.,
 
        split($1,x,"string")
 
   how can i find out how many elements x has (i mean other than
   testing for null string or doing a for (n in x) test)?

use the return value of split()

        n = split($1, x, "string")


========================================================================

18. How can I split a string into characters?

in portable POSIX awk, the only way to do this is to use substr to pull
out each character, one by one.  this is painful.  however, gawk, mawk,
and the newest version of the Bell Labs awk all allow you to set
FS = "" and use "" as the third argument of split.

so, split("chars",anarray,"") results in the array anarray containing
5 elements -- "c", "h", "a", "r", "s".

if you don't have any ^As in your string, you could try:

{
        string=$0;
        gsub(".", "&\001", string)
        n=split(string, anarray, "\001")
        for (i=1;i<=n;i++) print i "=>" anarray[i];
}


========================================================================

19. How do I use tolower() in the SunOS nawk?

I want to use the tolower() function with SunOS nawk, but all I get is

        nawk: calling undefined function tolower

The SunOS nawk is from a time before awk acquired the tolower() and
toupper() functions. Either use one of the freely available awks, or
write your own function to do it using index, substr, and gsub.

An example of such a function is in O'Reilly's _Sed & Awk_.


========================================================================

20. How do I have dynamic-width printf strings, like C?

with modern awks, just do it like you would in C:

        maxlen=0

        for (i in arr)
          if (maxlen<length(arr[i]))
            maxlen=length(arr[i])

        for (i in arr)
          printf("%-*s %s\n",maxlen,arr[i],i)

with old awks, just do it like you would do if you didn't know about %*:

        maxlen=0

        for (i in arr)
          if (maxlen<length(arr[i]))
            maxlen=length(arr[i])

        printfstring="%-" maxlen "s %s\n";
        for (i in arr)
          printf(printfstring,arr[i],i)


========================================================================

21. Why doesn't "\\$" behave like /\\$/ ?

because the first is a string, so some of the escape characters get
eaten up (like \" to escape a double-quote within the string).

/\\$/ => regular expression: literal backslash at end-of-expression

"\\$" => string: \$ => regular expression: literal dollar sign

to get behavior like the first case in a string, use "\\\\$" .


========================================================================

22. What is gawk's exit code?

normally, the `exit' command exits with a value of zero.

you can supply an optional numeric value to the `exit' command to
make it exit with a value:

    if (whatever)
        exit 12

if you have an END block, control first transfers there.  within
the END block, an `exit' command exits immediately; if you had
previously supplied a value, that value is used.  but, if you
give a new value to `exit' within the END block, the new value is
used.  this is documented in the GNU Awk User's Guide (gawk.texi).

if you have an END block, you may have to do something like this:

BEGIN {
  ...
  exitcode=0;
  ...
}

{
  ...
  if (fatal)
  {
    exitcode=12;
    exit(exitcode);
  }
  ...
}

END {
  if (exitcode)
    exit(exitcode);
  ...
}


========================================================================

23. How can I get awk to be case-insensitive?

  23.1. use tolower()
    - portable
    - must be explicitly used for each comparison

    instead of:
      if (avar=="a" || avar=="A") { ... }
    use:
      if (tolower(avar)=="a") { ... }

  23.2. use IGNORECASE=1;
    - probably gawk only
    - used for all comparisons


========================================================================

24. How can I force a numeric/non-numeric comparison?

to compare two variables as numbers ONLY, use

  if (var1+0 == var2+0)

to compare two variables as non-numeric strings ONLY, use

  if ("" var1 == "" var2)


========================================================================

25. Why does { FS=":"; print $1 } not split the first record?

basically, you should set FS before it's needed to split $0 into fields.
once awk encounters a `{', it may already be too late.

some awk implementations set the fields at the beginning of the
block, and don't re-parse just because you changed FS.  to get
the desired behavior, you must set FS _before_ reading in a line.

e.g.,
  BEGIN { FS=":" }
  { print $1 }

e.g.,
  awk -F: '{ print $1 }'

if you run code like this

{ FS=":"; print $1 }

on this data:

first:second:third but not last:fourth
First:Second:Third But Not Last:Fourth
FIRST:SECOND:THIRD BUT NOT LAST:FOURTH

you may get either
  this:       or this:
  ----        -------
  first       first:second:third
  First       First
  FIRST       FIRST

========================================================================

26. Did ^ and $ and . change in gawk?

yes.  early versions cared about \n (newlines) and treated them
specially.  version 3.* and later are more POSIX-compliant here.


========================================================================

27. Why doesn't awk 'begin {...}' work?

it needs to be `BEGIN' (i.e., it's case-sensitive).


========================================================================

I expect most of the information in this FAQ to be supplied by people
other than myself -- it's just going to work better that way.  The
newsgroup readers have a LOT more awk experience than I ever will
(unless I multiply myself by a few thousand, which is not legal with
today's tax laws).

   th' usual wahr an' stuff, as requahred.


How d'ya do it, Joe?
_____________________

Wal, ya find a ol' shack on a hill somewheres that still got pahr
goin' to it.  (Elsewise, ya gots ta use a whole lotta ol' truck
batt'ries, which is tuff ta hump around.) Put th' crock in th' shack,
and pour th' Jolt water inta it.  Stir in th' Lithium Lye, slow an'
careful. Don't splash none, an' don't add th' stuff too quick, now.
Cover it real taht, so's ya don't lose too much. Y'all don't wanna
hafta sneak inta th' navybase again, do ya? Them guys got guns & stuff
and they ain't afraid ta use it.

So, ennyway, see, ya bild the pahr splah, an' ya bild th' currint
reggalater in figger 3 at th' end of th' chapter, the one with the
special shunt cirkit fer changin' the currint. Thet's whar th'
Kickass tahmer goes. Test it ta be sure that th' current starts at
about 30 amps and goes down ta 10 or 15 when th' tahmer goes off.

Bild th' other stuff lahk in figger 2. Cart th' whole mess down ta th'
shack, and put th' bizniz end inta the Jolt water. Don't leave th' lid
off too long, now. Cover it up good, an' duck tape it, specially th'
place wher the wahrs come out. Ah got me some motorcycle ground strap,
which is read'ly avail'ble an' flat, so it don't queer up the fit o'
the lid. Bolt the straps down real secure, an' put vaseline on th'
bolts.

Now, set th' Kickass tahmer fer 8 weeks, plug th' pahr splah in,
make sure ya got 30 amps, an' take a hike.

'Member, neutrons ain't yer frens. Keep ol' Blue away from th' shack
unless ya want two-headed puppies runnin' around eatin' too much,
probly worrit yore mom no end, an' if ya gotta go in ther ta check,
don't stay long. Ya want ol' Joe's advice, after around 7 weeks, don't
go in ther atall.

This hear makes a real 'hot flash', an' in fact, it's whut this book
is named fer. Y'all kin see th' flash from a couple mahls away, raht
through th' av'ridge wall, so don't go bildin' it in yer basemit. Got
thet?  No need ta keep it too close ta home, raht? Ya kin get caught
with it if it's too close. Besides, ya don't want yer sister fahndin'
out wher her earrin's got off ta. She probly woont lahk it, an' she'll
make ya cut her in on the deal. 'Course, thet maht not be too bad, if
she's good with a soldrin' ahrn. Probly bilds good pahr splahs, an
that's importunt ta this 'hot flash'.

Ah got trouble, Joe. Now whut?

For all who have ever had any dealings with the banks..... This is an
actual letter sent to a Bank in the US. The Bank thought it amusing
enough to publish it in the New York Times.


Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to thank you for bouncing the cheque with which I
endeavoured to pay my plumber last month. By my calculations some
three nanoseconds must have elapsed between his presenting the cheque,
and the arrival in my account of the funds needed to honour it. I
refer, of course, to the automatic monthly deposit of my entire 
salary, an arrangement which, I admit, has only been in place for eight
years.

You are to be commended for seizing that brief window of opportunity,
and also for debiting my account with $50 by way of penalty for the
inconvenience I caused your bank. My thankfulness springs from the
manner in which this incident has caused me to re-think my errant
financial ways.

You have set me on the path of fiscal righteousness. No more will our
relationship be blighted by these unpleasant incidents, for I am
restructuring my affairs in 2000, taking as my model the procedures,
attitudes and conduct of your very own bank. I can think of no greater
compliment, and I know you will be excited and proud to hear it. To
this end, please be advised about the following:

First, I have noticed that whereas I personally attend to your telephone
calls and letters, when I try to contact you I am confronted by the
impersonal, ever-changing, pre-recorded, faceless entity which your bank
has become. From now on I, like you, choose only to deal with a flesh and
blood person. My mortgage and loan repayments will, therefore and
hereafter, no longer be automatic, but will arrive at your bank, by
cheque, addressed personally and confidentially to an employee of your
branch, whom you must nominate.

You will be aware that it is an offence under the Postal Act for any
other person to open such an envelope. Please find attached an
Application Contact Status which I require your chosen employee to
complete. I am sorry it runs to eight pages, but in order that I know
as much about him or her as your bank knows about me, there is no
alternative. Please note that all copies of his or her medical history
must be countersigned by a Justice of the Peace, and that the mandatory
details of his/her financial situation (income, debts, assets and
liabilities) must be accompanied by documented proof.

In due course I will issue your employee with a PIN number which he/she
must quote in all dealings with me. I regret that it cannot be shorter
than 28 digits but, again, I have modelled it on the number of button
presses required to access my account balance on your phone bank
service. As they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

Let me level the playing field even further by introducing you to my
new telephone system, which you will notice, is very much like yours.
My Authorised Contact at your bank, the only person with whom I will
have any dealings, may call me at any time and will be answered by an
automated voice. By pressing Buttons on the phone, he/she will be
guided through an extensive set of menus:

 1.   To make an appointment to see me.

 2.   To query a missing repayment.

 3.   To make a general complaint or inquiry.

 4.   To transfer the call to my living room in case I am there;
      Extension of living room to be communicated at the time the
      call is received.

 5.   To transfer the call to my bedroom in case I am sleeping;
      Extension of bedroom to be communicated at the time the call
      is received.

 6.   To transfer the call to my toilet in case I am attending to
      nature; Extension of toilet to be communicated at the time the
      call is received.

 7.   To transfer the call to my mobile phone in case I am not at home.

 8.   To leave a message on my computer. To leave a message a password
      to access my computer is required. Password will be communicated
      at a later date to the contact.

 9.   To return to the main menu and listen carefully to options 1
      through 9.
      
The contact will then be put on hold, pending the attention of my
automated answering service. While this may on occasion involve a
lengthy wait, uplifting music will play for the duration. This month
I've chosen a refrain from The Best Of Woody Guthrie:

                 ......."Oh, the banks are made of marble
                         With a guard at every door
                         And the vaults are filled with silver
                         That the miners sweated for"

After twenty minutes of that, our mutual contact will probably know it
off by heart.

On a more serious note, we come to the matter of cost. As your bank has
often pointed out, the ongoing drive for greater efficiency comes at a
cost - a cost which you have always been quick to pass on to me. Let me
repay your kindness by passing some costs back.

First, there is the matter of advertising material you send me. This I
will read for a fee of $20/page. Enquiries from your nominated contact
will be billed at $5 per minute of my time spent in response. Any debits
to my account, as, for example, in the matter of the penalty for the
dishonoured cheque, will be passed back to you. My new phone service runs
at 75 cents a minute (even Woody Guthrie doesn't come free), so you would
be well advised to keep your enquiries brief and to the point.

Regrettably, but again following your example, I must also levy an
establishment fee to cover the setting up of this new arrangement.

May I wish you a happy, if ever-so-slightly less prosperous New Year.

<name>

Your humble client.

CLEAN HUMOR - DIRTY HUMOR - CLEAN HUMOR - DIRTY HUMOR - CLEAN HUMOR

          http://www.mother.com/~virtual/without_a_paddle/

My hobby can be your gain. I've been collecting humorous jokes and 
stories for what seems like ages now. I have placed them all here 
for you to use. Don't expect the ultimate archive from here but 
since it's almost all free what do you have to complain about 
anyway. Hey, I get a thousand visitors a day, it can't be that bad.

I use Adult Check to get into the pornographic section and it can 
in theory earn me some money. If it earns me enough to pay for the 
web space I'll be ecstatic.  In the meantime, enjoy this sample. 
I'll post more periodically. Once a week maybe? If that's too much 
or too little let me know.

Grand Prize Winner:

When a cat is dropped, it always lands on its feet, and when toast is dropped, it always lands with the buttered side facing down.  I propose to strap buttered toast to the back of a cat; the two will hover, spinning inches above the ground.  With a giant buttered cat array, a high-speed monorail could easily link New York with Chicago.

Runners-up:

If an infinite number of rednecks riding in an infinite number of pickup trucks fire an infinite number of shotgun rounds at an infinite number of highway signs, they will eventually produce all the worlds great literary works in Braille.

Why Yawning Is Contagious:  You yawn to equalize the pressure on your eardrums.  This pressure change outside your eardrums unbalances other people's ear pressures, so they must yawn to even it out.

Communist China is technologically underdeveloped because they have no alphabet and therefore cannot use acronyms to communicate ideas at a faster rate.

The earth may spin faster on its axis due to deforestation.   Just as a figure skater's rate of spin increases when the arms are brought in close to the body, the cutting of tall trees may cause our planet to spin dangerously fast.

Honorable Mentions:

Birds take off at sunrise.  On the opposite side of the world, they are landing at sunset.  This causes the earth to spin on its axis.

The reason hot-rod owners raise the backs of their cars is that it's easier to go faster when you're always going downhill.

The quantity of consonants in the English language is constant.  If omitted in one place, they turn up in another.  When a Bostonian "pahks" his "cah," the lost r's migrate southwest, causing a Texan to "warsh" his car and invest in "erl wells."

 The Rules of Bedroom Golf


   Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play -
   normally one club and two balls.
   
   Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole.
   
   Unlike outdoor gold, the object is to get the club in the hole
   and keep the balls out of the hole.
   
  For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft.
   Course owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play
   begins.
   
  Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to
   avoid damage to the hole.
   
   The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary
   until the course owner is satisfied that the play is complete.
   Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the
   course again.
   
   It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole
   immediately upon arrival at the course. The experienced player
   will normally take time to admire the entire course, with special
   attention to well formed bunkers.
   
   Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have
   played or are currently playing, to the owner of the course being
   played. Upset course owners have been known to damage player's
   equipment for this reason.
   
   Players are encouraged to bring proper rain gear for their own
   protection.
   
   Players should assure themselves that their match has been
   properly scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played
   for the first time. Previous players have been known to become
   irate if they discover someone else playing on what they consider
   to be a private course.
   
   Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all
   times. Some players may be embarrassed if they find the course to
   be temporarily under repair. Players are advised to be extremely
   tactful in this situation. More advanced players will find
   alternative means of play when this is the case.
   
   Players are advised to obtain the course owner's permission
   before attempting to play the back nine.
   
   Slow play is encouraged. However, players should be prepared
   to proceed at a quicker pace, at least temporarily, at the course
   owner's request.
   
   It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to
   play the same hole several times in one match.
   
   The course owner will be the judge of who is the best player.

TOP TEN REASONS WHY BEER IS BETTER THAN JESUS

10. No one will kill you for not drinking beer.

9. Beer doesn't tell you how to have sex.

  2.  Try to work alone, an audience is rarely any help.
 
  3.  Despite what you may have been told by your mother, praying and
      cursing are both helpful in home repair...but only if you are
      working alone.
 
  4.  Work in the kitchen whenever you can...many fine tools are there.
      Its warm and dry, and you are close to the refrigerator.
 
  5.  If it's electronic, get a new one, or consult a twelve-year-old.
 
  6.  Stay simple minded, Plug it in, Get a new battery, Replace the
      bulb or fuse, See if the tank is empty, Try turning it to the
      "on" switch, or Just paint over it.
 
  7.  Always take credit for miracles.  If you dropped the alarm clock
      while taking it apart, and it suddenly starts working, you have
      healed it.
 
  8.  Regardless what people say, kicking, pounding, throwing, and

?	Beer is apparently cheaper now than it ever was, relative to income.  In
1925, a gentleman could spend his weeks pay and get 77 tallies (750 mL
bottles).  The same gentleman in 1957 could spend his weeks wage on 89
bottles.  1969's average wage netted 93 bottles of beer, and in 1997, the
average wage can buy 119 bottles of beer, or 90 litres a week.

?	In 1876, Melbourne had 1049 pubs for a population of under 800,000
people, which works out at one pub for every 725 men, women, and children. 
In the same year, Ballarat in Victoria had one pub for every 180 people.

?	The strongest beer in the world is Baz's Super Brew, brewed by Barrie
Parish and sold only at the Parish Brewery in Somerby UK.  It is 23 per
cent ABV.

?	The oldest brewery in the world is Weihenstephen Brewery in Freising,
near Munich Germany.  It was founded in 1040AD.

?	The Czechs are the worlds greatest beer drinkers, downing approximately
160 litres per head (1994).  The most sozzled city in the world is Darwin,
NT, Australia, where punters drink 230 litres per person per year.

?	The largest collection of beer coasters in the world is owned by Leo
Pisker of Austria, and numbers 70,000.       

?	The longest bar in the world used to be the bar at the Mildura Workers
Club, but sadly no longer exists.  Now the longest bar is the bar in the
Beer Barrel Saloon, in Ohio USA.  It measures in at 123 metres long, and
has 55 beer taps.

?	The world record for sculling a gallon (4.5 litres) of beer is 3 minutes,
35 seconds, by David Arsenault of Canada.  This also includes a 1 minute
penalty for spilling.

?	The ring pull can was invented in 1962.  Before that, every keyring
included a "church key", used for puncturing  the can.

?	If your beer is "piss weak", you could try "lienting" it.  This 17th
century English practice means "to put urine into it to make it strong".

?	1,742,000,000 litres of beer was produced in Australia in 1995.  This
number had fallen by 60 million litres since 1992.

Security is the eternal problem of utilities.  Few people steal water
from the distribution pipes because it's so cheap that it's not worth
the effort involved.  Few people steal electricity because it's pretty
cheap too and requires special skills to handle safely.  Few people
steal sewage for obvious reasons.  Lots of people steal cable
television, because it's priced way above the cost of delivery, thus the
escalation of the scrambling and piracy wars.

Now, beer is something worth stealing.  Furthermore, your best customers
are likely to be buildings full of engineering students.  Just try
building a student-proof beer meter!  If they can't bypass the measuring
system, they'll break the microcontroller and make it report whatever
numbers they want.

Consider the social effects of a beer utility.  Of course, someone would
pass a law requiring a cardswipe device at every tap, to protect
innocent children, at which point the ACLU would sue, taking valuable
dollars away from their net freedom campaign.  Since it costs a fair bit
to do a credit card verification, the price per use would quickly
approach what you'd pay elsewhere.  It'd be taxed to death, too.  Maybe
they'd even put a regulator in the meter to prevent it dispensing more
than N pints per day, thereby defeating the original purpose of
preventing drunk drivers when partygoers go out for fresh supplies.

People would publish studies pointing out correlations between violent
crime and the availability of the beer utility, neglecting to point out
that crime happens in cities and cities are the only place where it's
cost-effective to set up.  Do-gooding teatotallers would make trouble by
refusing to allow you to run the pipes under their property, and
campaigning for public land to be the same way.

Unless you kept the pipes really thin and the flow rate up, requiring
strong pipes and high pressures, you'd have a lot of beer sitting in the
pipes at any given moment, going stale all the time.  You might just as
well re-route the output of the urinals to the taps and create a
self-contained beer loop.

Now, a nanobrewery in your fridge... there's an idea!

Some new billboards are getting attention in Cleveland. Some people

The billboards are a simple black background with white text. No fine

Keep using my name in vain, I'll make rush hour longer.

                              Bill's New House

     While the Gates are moving in from their temporary quarters
     nearby, final construction of their new house is not expected to
     be completed until the end of the year !!
     Bill has a meeting with the contractor....

     Bill: "There are a few issues we need to discuss."

     Contractor: "Ah, you have our basic support option. Calls are free
     for the first 90 days and $75 a call thereafter. Okay?"

     Bill: "Uh, yeah... the first issue is the living room. We think
     its a little smaller than we anticipated."

     Contractor: "Yeah. Some compromises were made to have it out by
     the release date."

     Bill: "We won't be able to fit all our furniture in there."

     Contractor: "Well, you have two options. You can purchase a new,
     larger living room or you can use a Stacker."

     Bill: "Stacker?"

     Contractor: "Yeah, it allows you to fit twice as much furniture
     into the room. By stacking it, of course, you put the
     entertainment center on the couch... the chairs on the table...
     etc. You leave an empty spot, so when you want to use some
     furniture you can unstack what you need and then put it back when
     you're done."

     Bill: "Uh... I dunno... issue two. The second issue is the light
     fixtures. The bulbs we brought with us from our old home won't
     fit. The threads run the wrong way."

     Contractor: "Oh! Thats easy. Those bulbs aren't plug and play.
     You'll have to upgrade to the new bulbs."

     Bill: "And the electrical outlets? The holes are round, not
     rectangular. How do I fix that?"

     Contractor: "Just uninstall and reinstall the electrical system."

     Bill: "You're kidding!?"

     Contractor: "Nope. Its the only way."

     Bill: " Well... I have one last problem. Sometimes, when I have
     guests over someone will flush the toilet and it won't stop. The
     water pressure drops so low that the showers don't work."

     Contractor: "That's a resource leakage problem. One fixture is
     failing to terminate and is hogging the resources preventing
     access from other fixtures."

     Bill: "And how do I fix that?"

     Contractor: "Well, after each flush, you all need to exit the
     house, turn off the water at the street, turn it back on, reenter
     the house and then you can get back to work."

     Bill: "That's the last straw. What kind of product are you selling
     me?"

     Contractor: "Hey, if you don't like it nobody made you buy it."

     Bill: "And when will this be fixed?"

     release sometime near the end of next year. Actually it was due
     out this year, but we've had some delays..."

I highly recommend a study of William Blake. You might start with The
Marriage of Heaven and Hell.

More Blakeisms:

And builds a Heaven in Hell's despair
And builds a Hell in Heaven's despite

The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.
He who desires but acts not, breeds pestilence.
If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise.

Prisons are built with stones of Law,
Brothels with bricks of Religion.

The lust of the goat is the bounty of God.
The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God.
The nakedness of woman is the work of God.

Every thing possible to be believ'd is an image of truth.
The tygers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction.
Every Wolf's & Lion's howl raises from Hell a Human Soul.

Thy Heaven doors are my Hell Gates;

Truly, My Satan, thou art but a Dunce

Now the sneaking serpent walks in mild humility
And the just man rages in the wilds where lions roam.

O Urizen! Creator of men! mistaken Demon of heaven!
Mad, he danc'd on his mountains high & dark as heaven.

But Mark! Active Evil is better than Passive Good.
This Angel, who is now become a Devil, is my particular friend

A dragon form, clashing his scales: at midnight he arose,
America is darken'd; and my punishing Demons, terrified,

the study of angels, the workmanship of demons

Art thou she that made the nations drunk with the cup of Religion?
furious lions sound the song of Joy
The cruel joy of Luvah's daughters, lacerating with knives
They catch the shrieks in cups of gold,
But the Human Wine stood wondering;

And was Jerusalem builded here among these dark Satanic Mills?

Suffer not the fashionable Fools to depress your powers

And in its Holiness is closed the Abomination of Desolation.

I must Create a System or be enslav'd by another Man's.

I will not Reason & Compare: my business is to Create.
Calling on God for help, and not ourselves, in whom God dwells,

Mystery, Babylon the Great, The Druid Dragon & hidden Harlot
Dazzling around thy skirts like a Serpent of precious stones
Am I not Lucifer the Great, and you my daughters?

 
I just went through a copy of his Collected Works and keyed into my
tagfile any lines that struck my eye.

*************************************************************

Jew dies, goes to heaven. Meets St. Peter at the pearly gates. Gets 
guided tour of heaven.  At one point they come to a huge wall; say's 
St. Peter, "Sshh." Jew asks why. St. Peter says "On the other side 
of the wall are the Christians, and they think they're the only ones
here."
----------------    

Q: What did the lions say when the Emperor of Rome threw the    
   Christians into the arena?
A: Yum!
----------------

Up in Heaven, God was feeling tired.  He had been a busy deity lately.
Anyways, St. Peter suggests he should go on vacation.  "Where?", rants
God, "I created everything!  I know what everything is!!"  "Well",
replies St. Peter, "Earth is a nice place.  You could go there." "Ohh
no!  Not Earth!", says God, "I went there about two thousand years
ago, screwed some chick, and they're *still* talking about it!"
----------------

Jesus walks into a hotel, tosses three nails on the front desk and 
says, "Hey, can you put me up for the night?"
---------------- 

Jesus, hanging on the cross, spots Peter in the crowd at the bottom 
of the hill. "Peter," he calls. "Peter." Peter hears his name and 
replies, "I hear, Lord, I'm coming," and starts up the hill toward 
the cross. A Roman guard blocks Peter's way and says, "Stop, or I'll 
cut off your arm." But Peter says, "I must go on, my Lord is calling 
me," and tries to pass the guard, who cuts off his arm with a sword. 
Jesus calls again, "Peter, Peter...", so Peter continues, bleeding 
and in terrible pain, up the hill toward the cross. Another guard 
blocks his way and says, "Stop, or I'll cut off your other arm." Peter

ignores this, saying, "I must go on, my Lord is calling me." As Peter
tries to pass the second guard, the guard cuts off his other arm with 
his sword. Jesus calls again, "Peter...," so Peter, getting weak from 
the pain, continues up the hill. A third guard blocks his way and
says, "Stop, or I'll cut off your leg."  Peter says to the guard, "I
must go on, my Lord is calling me."  As Peter tries to continue up the
hill, the guard cuts off his leg. Peter falls in a heap of pain and
blood, but still manages to push and drag himself up the hill toward
the cross with his one remaining leg. Jesus calls again,
"Peter...Peter..." Peter replies, "I hear, Lord, I'm coming." Another
guard steps in front of Peter and says, "Stop, or I'll cut off your
other leg." Peter squirms top try to pass the guard, so the guard cuts
off Peter's other leg. In excruciating pain, Peter uses sheer
willpower to drag his mutilated body to the base of the cross.
Panting, he raises his eyes toward Jesus and says, "I am here, Lord. I
have answered your call. Jesus looks down at Peter and says, "Peter...
I can see your house from here."

On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me
A beer.
On the second day of Christmas, my true love gave to me
Two turtlenecks and a beer.
OK, for brevity, I'll now start at the top:
Eight comic books
Seven packs of smokes
A six-pack of Tuborg
Five golden touques
Four pounds of back bacon
Three french toast
Two turtlenecks
And a beer ... in a tree.
(Where'd you learn that last part, eh?)
(Albums)


Hope this helps.  This is one of our family favorites.
Kind of embarrassing when the four-year-old belts it out to the
grandparents, though.

OK, I guess it's time for me to post my quotes list again.  As usual
(well, kind of -- I've only posted them once before), I will post them
in random order, without attributions, so you can have fun figuring out
where they came from.  In about a week, I'll post the original file,
with the attributes in comments.  I'll also post the wimpy program I
use that reads my .fortunes file.

I have two criteria for my quotes: a) it must be public (ie I don't
include quotes my friend Joe Shmoe said.  People who have tastes very
similar to mine conceivably could recognize all of these quotes) and b)
it must have made me laugh out loud.  This explains why my list is
relatively short (currently, there are 159 entries).

I will happily take corrections to the wording of the quotes, but,
please, no suggestions for additional quotes.  Somehow, this list is
very personal, and if I don't spot the quote myself, I probably won't
include it.  Oh, plaudits, compliments, and the like are welcome -- in
fact they are required.

"Wheat.  So what?"

"A penny for your thoughts?"
"A dollar for your death."

"Get a life!"

...And since the stench of death will always attract flies and vermin,
the arrival of Geraldo was perhaps inevitable.

"I'm sorry, but you must have me confused with some OTHER
plate-lipped white girl named `Irene'"

"You're just the sort of person I imagined marrying, when I was little...
..except, y'know, not green...
...and without all the patches of fungus."

Every now and then when your life gets complicated and the weasels
start closing in, the only real cure is to load up on heinous chemicals
and then drive like a bastard from Hollywood to Las Vegas.

"Oh Mr. Bellpit, your legs are so swollen!"

"It's Czechoslovakia!  It's like going into Wisconsin!"

The heart, the liver, the spleen, the pancreas.  All these miraculous
organs work in _total_darkness_!

"Nice tie... BONEHEAD!"

"Bicycle Repair Man, how can I ever repair you?"
"Well, you don't need to, gov, it's all right.
It's all in a day's work for ... Bicycle Repair Man. <Sniff!>"

"Comedy.  Sudden, violent, comedy!"

"Bring the little ones unto me, and I will get
a good price for them."

"What do you say we guys go down to the beach and shoot
some clams?"

"Zere were zwei peanuts walking down ze strasse.
And one was assaulted.. peanut.  Ha ha ha.."

Ant Boy calmly prepares to execute his new friend ant-style...

You think you got it rough?
What about your darling doggy?
Ten short years
and he's getting old and groggy.

"I'm not saying we won't get our hair mussed a bit.."

"Thank God.  The police."

"I don't know what you want here, but I think you should
know that I've killed a LOT of old people in my time,
and I'm not above doing it again."

Damnedest thing I ever saw."

"I've heard about these cult jamborees.  It's an international
goon gathering.  Lots of howling and drinking... Orgiastic
worship of heathen idols... Great looking chicks in diaphanous robes..."

"Do you think there's a God?"
"Well, SOMEbody's out to get me!"

"I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid."

"Flint Paper is insane.  I really respect that."

"Llamas are larger than frogs."

"It's no longer a blue world, Max.  Where can we go?"

have made them cute and furry. 

"The evidence before the court is
incontrovertible; there's
no need for the jury to
retire."

"Round up the usual suspects!"

"Well, it's garish, ugly, and derelicts have used it
for a toilet.  The rides are dilapidated to the point
of being lethal, and could easily maim or kill innocent
little children."
"Oh, so you don't like it?"
"Don't like it?  I'm CRAZY for it."

"Mr. Notlob, there's nothing wrong with you that an expensive
operation can't prolong!"

"If I could walk that way, I wouldn't need the aftershave."

"If you could have any amount of money... How much would you want?"
"All of it."

"Have you got a 27 B stroke 6?"

"Don't be stupid.  Be a smarty.
 Come and join the Nazi Party."

"Take me away, imperialist puppets of the great Pay-TV satanistic
corporate booger-heads!"

"I want a full scale Red Alert throughout the world.  Surround EVERYONE
with EVERYTHING we got!  Mobilize every fighting unit and every weapon

nuclear alerts, with every Army, Navy, and Air Force unit on ETERNAL standby!"

"Ho!  Ha-ha!  Guard!  Turn!  Parry!  Dodge!  Spin!  Ha!  Thrust!"

A hundred bottles of beer on the wall, a hundred bottles
of beer.  If one of those bottles should happen to

"You have an annoying fascination for timepieces, Mr. Sulu"

"Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!"

"You know, once in a while it is my pleasure, and my privilege to welcome
here at the Refreshment Room some of the truly great international
artists our time.  And tonight we have one such artist.  Ladies and
gentlemen, someone who I've always personally admired, perhaps
more deeply, more strongly, more ... abjectly than other performer.
A man, well, more than a man, a god!  A great god, whose personality
is so totally and utterly wonderful, that my feeble words of welcome
sound wretchedly and pathetically inadequate.  Someone whose boots I
would gladly lick clean, until holes wore through my tongue!  A man
who is so totally and utterly wonderful, that I would rather be sealed
in a pit of my own filth than dare tread on the same stage with him!
Ladies and Gentlemen, the incomparably superior human being, Harry Fink!"

-BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL #7

So I manage AT LONG LAST, to get a couple of hours off for lunch, AND,
because
I can't
leave my desk unattended, I get the janitor in and have him sit in my chair.
I tell him that
all he has to do is make sure the receiver doesn't accidentally get put back
on the hook. He
agrees and I'm off.

First stop, the bank.   I change a $50 note into quarters and then ask to
see
a balance of
my account. Then I yank the power lead out of the teller's vdu. It dies.  I
say I'm in a hurry
and is the manager around?

He rolls over like a man-sized twinkie and asks what the problem is.  I say
that all I want
is a balance of my accounts.  I cross my fingers.  YES! He finds the vdu
lead
out, plugs it
in, and logs in, TO THE MANAGER'S ACCOUNT. Now's my chance - I slip up
against
the
counter, slopping 200 coins across the counter.  The manager ignores it, but
all the
tellers dive for the money.  I watch, unobserved, as the manager types in
his
password at
the breakneck speed of one character a minute. At that rate I should've got
$100 worth....
He finishes typing.   "MONEY".  What a toughy!  Well, that's my mortgage
taken
care of
tonight...

A user that I recognise from "D(eletion) day '89" approaches.  I think he's
going to talk to
me.  Even the bank manager is shaking his head furiously. But it's too late,
he stops.

"Um, excuse me, Could you tell me what is the best computer to buy to do my
thesis on?

?!

Right.

"You've heard of Commodore 64's?"   I ask

"Yes?.."

"Avoid them like the plague!  Not many people know this, but computers
aren't
made to
handle that much memory - it's over 64,000 things, more in some cases. It's
a
recipe for  disaster!"

"Oh!"

"Try something safe and proven.  A ZX81 with dual cassette drive if you can
get it.  The 1K
ram model.  Write that down.  Don't buy a disk drive - You know how they're
always
failing, but music cassettes last forever!"

"Hey thanks!"

"No worries.  What was your username again?"

He tells me.  Just in time for D-Day 92.  You'd think they'd learn.

I get back to work and the janitor's asleep at the terminal.  I ask him if
he
wants to work
here too, but he likes the ability to bust in on people when they're in the
toilet...

I put the phone back on the hook, and straight away it rings.  I hate it
when
it does that, it
takes me AGES to get my walkman phones in.

It's the hottest hosemonster I've ever met, and she's got a computer
problem!
I love it when that happens!

"What's your username?" I ask

She tells me (as if I didn't know)

Quick as I can I read all her e-mail (mostly boring stuff), then grep
everyone
else's mail  files for her username.  Nothing.  Excellent!

"What's the problem?" I ask, all smiles and charm.

"I can't save my documents, it says something about space."

"Not a problem for long" I say, and delete everyone else on the same disk as
her.  "You  should be fine now.."

"Thank you so much" she gushes.  I make a mental note to do something to her
account    again tomorrow. "No worries."

The phone rings almost before I've got it on the hook.

"My files are all gone!" a voice whines out at me.

"When did this happen?" I ask.

"Just now..." he says, through the tears

"I see.  Well, I wouldn't worry, there's three days till the end of the
semester, if you
work day and night until then, you should get at least a C-"

He sobs a couple more times then hangs up.  What a wimp.

THE PHONE RINGS AGAIN!

"The screen on my PC is really dim" The woman at the other end says  "Should
I
wind the
brightness knob up?"

"NO!" I scream  "Don't touch that knob!  Have you any idea of the radiation
that comes out of that thing when the knob gets wound up?!!!!"

"Well I..." she says, all uncertain

"TAKE MY ADVICE!"  I say "There's only ONE way to fix a dim display, and
that's by power surging the drivers"

The words "power surging" and "drivers" have got her.  People hear words
like
that and go
into dummy mode and do ANYTHING you say.  I could tell her to run naked
across
campus
with a powercord rammed up her backside and she'd probably do it...  Hmmm...

"Have you got a spare power cord?"

"No.."

"Oh well, never mind, we'll have to do the power surge idea...  Ok, quick as
you can, I want you to flick the power switch of your PC on and off 30
times"

"Should I take my disks out?"

"NO!  Do you want to lose all your data!?!"

"Oh.  No!  Ok.."

I listen carefully.. ..

...clicky..clicky...clikky.. .. .. ...clicky.     ...cliccy..
. . BOOM!

Amazing, it probably made it to 27 - the power supply usually shits itself
at
15 or so...

"MY COMPUTER BLEW UP!!!" she screams at me down the line

"Really?  Must've been a dodgy power supply!  Lucky we found out now!  Is
your
machine  still under warranty?"

"NO!"

"Dear oh dear.  Well, Best get it repaired then.  Did you backup your
files?"

"Yes, to the system, Yesterday, but all this morning's work is gone!"

"Oh dear.  What was your username, I'll just check that your backups worked
ok?"

She tells me....
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL #8

I'm at my desk as usual, and a user calls.

"Hello Computer Room, Simon here, How can I help" I answer

"I can't get into my account!" A user mumbles at me.

"What was your username please?" I say

They give me their username.  No worries.  I look in their account.

"No worries, it was just a badly made login file.  I've fixed it, you should
be able to login."

"Thanks!"

"No worries.   Have a nice day!"

WHAT IS THIS?  you're asking yourself.  Has the BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL
turned
over a new leaf?  Sold out?!   GONE INSANE?!!! Nope.  The BASTARD OPERATOR
FROM
HELL is being logfiled.  And if that's happen- ing, I'm being bugged as
well.
So I'm being
nice till I can find the bugs.  It shouldn't be long - bear with me.

Ah.  One in the phone handpeice.  Basic.  But then the boss is a sneaky
sort,
so there's
probably a couple more.  Ah!  And another in the base of the phone and one
inside my
keyboard.  Time for a mad coffee-spilling frenzy.  This is a big job, so I
bring the whole
jug over and wait for a witness.  The System Manager comes in.

"Where's that report of mine?" he asks in a surly manner - he's obviously
pissed that I
haven't implicated myself yet.  Antagonist Identified.  As the Principal of
"BASTARD
OPERATOR SCHOOL" (me) will tell you, "There's no problem so large it can't
be
solved by
killing the user off, deleting their files, closing their account and
reporting their REAL earnings to the IRS"

I pull his printout from under the coffee jug where I put it, and the coffee
splashes all
over the phone and keyboard, which for some reason were stacked on top of
each
other.

"Woopsy!"  I say, mock horror on my face.  The System Manager's face tells
me
I was
right in my guess.

"Don't think you'll get away with this!" he snarls and stomps off.

I click on the ethernet monitor and watch the traffic coming out of his PC.

Ah!  A memo, authorising the termination of my contract, going to the laser
in
the
director's office. I make a few alterations to the file in the spool
directory
and let it go to
it's destination.  I run my dinky little program that deposits -522 to the
PC
and our
mainframe shits itself.

Later, while booting, I'll remove that nasty logfile business.

      Next, I wander into the comms room and plug my earphone into the spare
RS232 port
in the Directors office.  It's amazing how simple it is to bug an office
once
it's got data
lines going to it!

Director: "Are you sure about this?" SysMgr: "OF COURSE!"
Director: "You don't want to reconsider?" SysMgr "NEVER!" Director:
"Very well, I'll fax it to staffing now.." SysMgr "EXCELLENT!"

Two seconds later the System Manager strolls in smiling. "Well, I'll really
miss you
Simon.." he says, full of himself.

"Oh?" I say, all sweetness and charm "Where are you going?"

"No Simon" he says, with glee "You're going"

"A PROMOTION!" I say "You've finally written that letter to the head of
staffing telling
him he's a bum-sucking arse bandit and that you quit?"

"No..."

"Are you sure?  It's much better than the one about me being fired.."

"Y.."  His eyes widen slightly

It's like clubbing a seal to death with a foam cushion.  He runs to stop the
fax.  Only,
having just resigned, >clicky cklikcy< his card key no longer works...

Ametuers...

The Phone rings.  It's the same guy as before

"I can get into my account now, but I've run out of disk"

"Hang on, I'll see what I can do"

>clicccky<... rm -r *

------------------------------------------------------------------------

BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL #9

I'm driving to work and I'm stuck behind this old guy, the classic slow
driver
from hell,
whose  car red-lines at 20 mph and can't take corners at more than 5.  I
honk
my horn
but his hearing aid's probably turned way down to "whisper", so I'm stuck.

I make a mental note of his license plate.  In fact, I did that 60 times a
minute for 15 and a
half minutes.  Oh dear.. oh dear....  Looks like another call to the DMV
Database to register
a vehicle as stolen by out of town arms dealers...

I get to work, flick the excuse page over.  "ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION FROM
SATTELLITE DEBRIS".  Fair enough, it looks like it's going to be a good day.

I log into "FUCKYOU", (the help-desk enquiries username) and go into mail.
There's 3
new messages, the first of which is 117 lines long, so it's obviously a
storyteller.  Shit, I
hate that. Instead of saying "My account needs more disk space" they tell
you
about how
they're doing this bit of research for a lecturer and how it's got to be in
yesterday, and
they almost had it but their second cousing twice removed had a perforated
herpes scab
and lost a lot of blood and had to be rushed into hospital... etc etc.  I
delete the message.

Second message I read, but it's one of those people who can't handle the
mail
interface and
send a null message, so all you get is headers.  I reply to the message
saying
"No worries,
we can do that by next tuesday".  Hope it was important.

The last message I leave for tommorrow, because Saturday would be a dull day
if I ever
had to work then.

The phone rings.  I thought I'd fixed that!

I put it on hands free so I can slop some pizza into the microwave.

"Yes" I call

"Something's wrong with my Boot disk, I can't login to the server"

"Have you got your disk with you?"

"Sure!"

I go get the disk and put it and the pizza in for 5 minutes on "ULTRA-NUKE".

Six minutes later, he rings back.

"It still doesn't work, and now my disk makes a funny noise and smells."

"OH SHIT!  It's that electromagnetic radiation from satellite debris again!"

"Really?  I think I heard about that!"  (What a tool!)

"Yep, I'm sorry, you'll have to buy another disk"

"Oh, that's ok, I don't mind, the old one was getting worn.  Thanks"

"Sure, no worries.  And be sure to run it through our virus checker FDISK
when
you get a
lot of important data on it..."

"I will!  Thanks!"

"That's Ok - it's my job!"

Xcbzone is running really slow so I kill off a whole lot of database
backends
that seem to
be hogging all the cpu and get back into my game.  Much better.

It isn't easy on the frontline, work work work...

I go to the cafeteria for a quick 2 hour snack - they're so nice to me
there.
They always
have been, ever since that computer glitch that registered their kitchen as
an
organ
recipient - very messy.  I grab a couple of cans of coke and some cheese
things and cruise
on back to the office via the first year computer funamentals lab.  I look
in
the window on
the scene that unfolds it- self to me - a lab full of first years with no
demonstrator.

WELL I'LL JUST HAVE TO HELP!

I walk on in.

"Right, I'm your temporary replacement demonstrator and today we're going to
put our
assignments aside for half an hour to learn about the REMARK function, or,
as
it's known
to the computer literate world, rm.."

I should have been a teacher you know - I've got this way with people... ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------


BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL #10

I get invited to a lecture as a guest speaker in "Computing Operations Fund-
amentals",  so
I  leave the control room in the capable hands of Sam, the janitor and
cruise
on down.

The lecture starts and goes ok, then there's a 10 minute period where
students
get to ask a
"real operator" questions that they have about operations.

I get out my pad and pen. "Before we get started" I say, "could you just
call
out your
username before you ask me a question, I find it easier to apply your
problem
to terms
you would understand better" The lecturer eats all this up - the personal
touch really
gets to them. "First Question, You over there.."

"What do you think of the privacy of individuals on a shared system?"

"What was your username please?"

"CMS1103"

>Scratchy scritch< "Computer Privacy...   Hmmm.  This is a toughy really.
You
mean
stuff like reading the email between you and your counsellor about you not
wanting to
come out of the closet?"

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGH!"

"AH.  Well, he seems to have left - must have picked a bad COMPLETELY RANDOM
example.  Next question.  You, over there..."

"CMS1136.  I was.."

"Ah yes, 1136 the only person on campus who subscribes to
alt.sex.buggery.by.
sailors.dressed.in.mums.clothing"

"It's purely for research purposes!"

"I'm sure it is.  You do a lot of story posting for a researcher don't you?"

"NNGggggAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHGH!"

"Next please..."

...

..

Two minutes later, the lecture theatre's empty. That's the problem with
students today,
they just don't want to learn.

I go back to control and Sam's asleep at the console again.  I think he's
after my job.  I
make a mental note to tap into the salary database and cancel his health and
accident
insurance payments.  You can't be too careful..

I put the phone on the hook for the first time this afternoon and it starts
ringing almost
immediately.  THAT'S IT!  I redirect it to 911 catch a bit of shuteye.
That'll teach them.
OOPS! Almost forgot to turn over the excuse calendar.  "STATIC FROM NYLON
UNDERWEAR"  Nope, too plausable - although in some cases I could do an
on-site
check.
Nah, can't be stuffed.  I'll pick another one.  "STATIC FROM PLASTIC SLIDE
RULES"  Now
THAT'S one with a challenge!

I un-redirect the phone and drag the rubbish bin so it rests on the
printer's
stacker -
another job well done.  The phone rings - this could be the big one!

"Hello?"

"Hi, Um, how do I spell-check my file?"

"Simple, just type `spell' and the filename"

"Thanks"

I'm so bloody nice this morning.  Especially as I know that my version of
spell introduces
errors instead  of detecting them.  Things like changing friend to freind
and
vice-versa.
What the hell.

The phone rings - it's them again.

"There's something wrong with spell"

"What makes you think that?"

"Because my file is all corrupt now!"

"That doesn't sound like spell to me.  Are you logged into thru PC?"

"Yes, but I can.."

"Please, leave the technical diagnosis to me...  Now, is there a plastic
ruler
somewhere on
or in the desk?"

"Um >clunka<, yes..."

"Right.  You've got a static buildup on your hard-drive caused by the
changing
electrostatic field generated by the ruler - the same one that makes bits of
paper stick to
it when you rub it up and down your arm..."

DUMMY MODE ON

"Oh.  What do I do?"

"You know how you get paper off a ruler by hitting it on a table lots of
times? Well do that
with your PC.  Say 20 times - lift it about a foot off the desk & drop it."

"Oh.  OK"

>crash<

>crash<

>crash<

"Um, the screen went dark"

"That's ok, it's supposed to do that - keep going.  And when you're
finished,
do the screen
as well, that static may have gone up the wires to it."

>crash<

>crash<

>crash<...

I hang up.   I get up and go out to the public area to put honey in the
floppy
drives when a
guy who looked like Lee Harvey Oswald runs up to me and shoots me, only the
sound comes
from the machine room, and I can hear the ex System- Managers chuckle....

Later, in the ambulance, I realise.  I forgot to get the guys username...

Then everything goes dark
------------------------------------------------------------------------


BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL LIVES! #11

The darkness cleared as we got out of the tunnel and it occurred to me that
I
couldn't be all  that injured.  Then again, maybe I was.  Someone was going
to
p..

I died.

Of course, a true BOFH considers this not really as dying, but more of going

Five seconds later, I'm getting the upside of 15Kv across the nipples.

BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL LIVES!


Three weeks later I'm back on my backside and feeling rested at relaxed
behind
the console
again. The rest has done me good, I feel *great!*.  I catch up on everyone's
email then let
the students know I'm back by performing an impromptu preventative
maintenance
in the
middle of lab time by kicking the restart switch (They love it really)

I flip today's excuse card,  "GLOBAL WARMING"  YES YES YES!  What a welcome
home!

It's the end of the month so all those automatic email reminder programs
will
be sending
messages all over the place.  I set the system clock back 7 days to buy some
peace and
quiet and swap the printer ribbon for the three year old one with holes in
it.

    I sort through my snail mail and crack open the BOFH Monthly Newsletter,
"kill -9"
and check out the articles therein.   There's a nice peice of making OS2
slow,
boring and
painful, but it looks exactly like the OS2 installation instructions to
me...
Ah, who knows.
I head straight to the BOFH Wizard section to see if any of my articles were
published.
All of them!!!  Even the one about the c compiler that randomly removes one
line from the
source code it's compiling!

The phone rings.

"The Screen on my PC is blank!!!"

"It's the power cord" I say

"No, I checked that.  When I switch it on, it does nothing!"

"It's the power cord" I say

"No, I checked and it's all plugged in properly.  There's no lights on the
keyboard or
anything"

"It's the power cord" I say

"Oh.  I just noticed, the cord's not plugged in properly!"

"The power cord?" I ask

"Yes...  Woopsy"

"No worries at all" I say "Is it all working well now?"

"Yes, I think so.  I'm sorry, you WERE right all along"

"Yes, we're getting a lot of this, it's due to the current Global Warming
problem.  It
causes random thermal expansion and contraction resulting in temperature
induced
movement of friction based holding mechanisms.."

I listen carefully.  Nothing.  In other words, ...

"You can fix it permanently tho'" I say

"Really?  How?"

"Well it's all to do with lowering salt deposits on the metal contacts"

"Oh!"  (Dummy mode irrevocably engaged)

"All you need to do is just take the power plug out deposit some dilute
mineral salts on it.
Do you have some dilute mineral salts on you?"

"Uh, no?"

"Ok, no worries, just stick it in your mouth drool into it.  But make sure
you
wipe the
plug first to get rid of any germs, and TURN THE SWITCH OFF ON THE MONITOR
before you
do - we don't want a nasty accident!

"Oh.  Ok!"

>Fzzzt< >clunk!<

I hang up as the receiver hits the floor.  Disk space is too good for them.

Brick Accident
 
  Dear Sir:
  I am writing in response to your request for additional information in Block #3 of the accident reporting form.  I put "Poor Planning" as the cause of my accident.  You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following details will be sufficient.
  I am a bricklayer by trade.  On the day of the accident, I was working alone on the roof of a new six-story building.  When I completed my work, I found I had some bricks left over which when weighed later were found to weigh 240 lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley which was attached to the side of the building at the sixth floor.
  Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it.  Then I went down and untied the rope, holding it tightly to insure a slow descent of the 240 lbs of bricks.  You will note on the accident reporting form that my weight is 135 lbs.
  Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope.  Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building.
  In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel which was now proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed.  This explains the fractured skull, minor abrasions and the broken collarbone, as listed in Section 3, accident reporting form.
  Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley which I mentioned in Paragraph 2 of this correspondence.  Fortunately by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in spite of the excruciating pain I was now beginning to experience.
  At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground-and the bottom fell out of the barrel.  Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, the barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs.
  I refer you again to my weight.  As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent down the side of the building.
  In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up.  This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and severe lacerations of my legs and lower body.
  Here my luck began to change slightly.  The encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked.
  I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain, unable to move and watching the empty barrel six stories above me, I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope.

	   Murphy's Laws and Other Observations

   Murphy's Law

1. If anything can go wrong, it will.
2. If there is a possibility of several things going wrong, the one that
   will cause the most damage will be the first one to go wrong.
3. If anything just cannot go wrong, it will anyway.
4. If you preceive that there are four possible ways in which something can
   go wrong, and circumvent these, then a fifth way, unprepared for, will
   promptly develop.
5. Left to themselves, things tend to go from bad to worse.
6. If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked
   something.
7. Nature always sides with the hidden flaw.
8. Mother Nature is a bitch.

   O'tooles Commentary On Murphy's Laws

Murphy was an optomist.

   Ginsberg's Theorems

1. You can't win.
2. You can't even break even.
3. You can't even quit the game.

   Forsyth's Second Corollary to Murphy's Laws

  Just when you see the light at the end of the tunnel, the roof caves in.

   Weilers Law

  Nothing is impossible for the man who doesn't have to do it himself.

   The Laws of Computer Programming

1. Any give program, when running, is obsolete.
2. Any given program costs more and takes longer each time it is run.
3. If a program is useful, it will have to be changed.
4. If a program is useless, it will have to be documented.
5. Any given program will expand to fill all the available memory.
6. The value of a program is inversely proportional to the weight of its
   output.
7. Program complexity grows until it exceeds the capability of the
   programmer who must maintain it.

[Let me preface this by saying that I have a brilliant calculus teacher,
known far and wide for his ability to make the subject as comprehensible
as it's ever gonna get.   Anyway, I was ripping my hair out over a problem
one evening and ended up writing the following instead, just to blow off
some steam.   Next day I submitted it to the campus rag and they were kind
enough to publish it the week before finals.   Probably why I passed.]


                   ANSWERS TO THE CALCULUS FINAL
               by A Concerned and Resourceful Student

We, the Calculus students of Foothill College, wish to voice our
dissatisfaction with the teaching practices of the Math Department here.
We feel that the Calculus professors are too strict and demanding,
assigning a preposterous workload and giving tests of immense difficulty.

We recognize that Calculus is an intrinsically challenging subject, but
this method of instruction makes classes nearly impossible to pass.   We
urge the Foothill College SENTINEL to join us in protest by allowing us to
publish, in advance, the following answers to the upcoming final exam, in
order to give students a more equitable chance at demonstrating their
knowledge of the subject.

Clip And Save:

1)  The Derivative Is Our Friend.

2)  The Derivative Is Very Useful.   (We know this because people use it
all the time.)

3)  The Derivative Is Very Old.   (This result can be obtained by looking
at how long the derivative has been around, and then subtracting from Now.)

4)  The Derivative was invented by two guys, one of whom was Newton, who
also makes a mighty nice cookie.

5)  a:  The limit of the sum is the sum of the limits.
    b:  The limit of the product is the product of the limits.
    c:  The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.  Or the one.

6)  The Derivative is Not Our Foe.   (This result is easily proved by
assuming that the derivative is our foe, then using #1 above to obtain a
contradiction.)

7)  ...NOW, multiply by the derivative of what's INSIDE the brackets...
with respect to x...

8)  When in doubt, refer to #1.

Extra Credit:

9)  1812.  (Trick question.  Every Calculus final requires at least one
problem with an actual numeric solution.  Students who forget this are
often tempted to put "Ulysses S. Grant" as the answer here.)

10)  Write a question appropriate for a Calculus final, then answer it.
Write a question appropriate for a Calculus final, then answer it.

A young woman who was several months pregnant boarded a bus. When she
noticed a young man smiling at her she began feeling humiliated on account
of her condition. She changed her seat and  he seemed more amused. She
moved again and then on her fourth  move he burst out laughing.  She had
him arrested.

When the  case came before the court this was the man's reply when asked 
why he acted in such a manner: "When the lady boarded the bus I couldn't
help noticing she was pregnant. She sat under an advertisement which read 
"Coming Soon: The Gold Dust Twins", then  she moved under one that read
"Sloans Liniments remove Swelling".  I was even more amused when she sat
under a shaving advertisement  which read "William Stick Did The Trick".
Then I could not  control myself any longer when on the fourth move she sat
under  an advertisement which read "Dunlop Rubber would have prevented 
this accident." 

He won the case.

Be careful what you wear (or don't wear) when working under your
vehicle... especially in public. From the Morning Herald, Sydney,
Australia, comes this story of a central west couple who drove their
car to K-Mart only to have it break down in the carpark. The man told
his wife to carry on with the shopping while he fixed the car there in
the park. 

The wife returned later to see a small group of people near the car. On
closer inspection she saw a pair of male legs protruding from under the
chassis. Although the man was in shorts, his lack of underpants turned
private parts into glaringly public ones. Unable to stand the
embarrassment, she dutifully stepped forward, quickly put her hands up
his shorts and tucked everything back into place. On regaining her
feet, she looked across the bonnet and found herself staring at her
husband who was standing idly by.

The mechanic, however, had to have three stitches in his head.

THE DIETER'S GUIDE TOT WEIGHT LOSS DURING SEX

How much weight do we lose during sex?  The diet
literature explains calories burned while jogging,
playing tennis or golfing, but similar information
concerning sexual activity has, until now, been
unavailable.  Yet, a survey of 206,000,000 people
indicated that 96% devote more time and effort to
sex than jogging, tennis, or golf, and we felt

     It was another Payday, and I was tired of being Mr. Goodbar.  So I saw Miss Hershey standing behind the Powerhouse on the corner of Clark and Fifth Avenue, and I whipped out my Whopper and whispered, "Hey Sweetart, how'd you like to Krunch on my Big Hunk for a Million Dollar Bar?"

     Well, she immediately went down on my Tootsie Roll, and, Uno, it was like pure Almond Joy.  I couldn't help but grab her delicious Mounds 'cause it was easy to see that this little Twix had the Red Hots.  It was all I could do to hold back a Snicker and a Krackle as my Butterfinger went up her tight little Kit Kat and she started to scream "Oh Henry, Oh Henry!"

     Soon she was fondling my Peter Paul and Zagnuts and I knew it wouldn't be long before I blew my Milkduds clear to Mars and gave her a taste of the old Milky Way.  She asked if I was into M&M, but I said "Hey Chiclet, no kinky stuff." I said "Look you little Reese Piece, don't be a Zero be a Lifesaver.  Why don't you just take my Whatchamacallit and slip it up your Bit O'Honey?" (And what a piece of JuicyFruit she was, too).

     She screamed, "Oh Crackerjack, you're better than the Three Musketeers!" as I rammed my Ding Dong up her Rocky Road and into her Peanut Butter Cup.  Well, I was givin' it to her Good 'n' Plenty, when all of the sudden...my Starburst!

     Yeah, as luck would have it, she started to grow a bit Chunky and complained of a Wrigley in her stomach.  Sure enough, nine months later, out popped............a Baby Ruth!

     So be carefull what candy you eat ! ! !

Wot they learn at Universite theze dais

DT:  Journal-Article
TI:  Spelunking as a manifestation of a counterclaustrophobia.
AU:  Myers,-Wayne-A.
JN:  Journal-of-the-American-Psychoanalytic-Association
PY:  1989

AB:  Material is presented from the case history of a 37-yr-old man
whose interest in spelunking (cave exploration) was an unconscious
expression of a type of counter claustrophobia.  Both oedipal and
preoedipal determinants of the claustrophobic anxieties are delineated.

The testicular element in the genesis of the patient's claustrophobia
is emphasized.  A counterphobic element of the spelunking per se was
the Ss' enjoyment in hanging suspended by a rope in caves.

In this manner, he was able to act out (by virtue of his body-testicle
equation) his identification with, and control over, the disappearing
testicles in the setting of a claustrophilic union with the mother.

The recent announcement that Donner and Blitzen have elected to take
the early reindeer retirement package has triggered a good deal of
concern about whether they will be replaced, and about other
restructuring decisions at the North Pole.

Streamlining was  due to the North Pole's loss of dominance of the
season's gift distribution business.  Home shopping channels and
mail order catalogues have diminished Santa's market share.  He could
not sit idly by and permit further erosion of the profit picture.

The reindeer downsizing was made possible through the purchase of
a late model Japanese sled for the CEO's annual trip.  Improved
productivity from Dasher and Dancer, who summered at the Harvard
Business School, is anticipated.  Reduction in reindeer will also
lessen airborne environmental emissions for which the North Pole
has received unfavourable press.

I am pleased to inform you that Rudolph's role will not be disturbed.
Tradition still counts for something at the North Pole. Management
denies, in the strongest possible language, the earlier leak that
Rudolph's nose got that way, not from the cold, but from substance
abuse.  Calling Rudolph "a lush who was into the sauce and never
did pull his share of the load" was an unfortunate comment, made by
one of Santa's helpers and taken out of context at a time of year when he
is known to be under executive stress.

As a further restructuring, today's global challenges require the
North Pole to continue to look for better, more competitive
steps.  Effective immediately, the following economy measures are to take
place in the "Twelve Days of Christmas" subsidiary:

 - The partridge will be retained, but the pear tree never turned
out to be the cash crop forecasted.  It will be replaced by a plastic
hanging plant, providing considerable savings in maintenance;

 - The two turtle doves represent a redundancy that is simply not
cost effective. In addition, their romance during working hours
could not be condoned. The positions are therefore eliminated;

 - The three French hens will remain intact.  After all,
everyone loves the French;

 - The four calling birds were replaced by an automated voice mail
system, with a call waiting option.  An analysis is underway to
determine who the birds have been calling, how often and how
long they talked;

 - The five golden rings have been put on hold by the Board of
Directors.  Maintaining a portfolio based on one commodity could
have negative implications for institutional investors.  Diversification
into other precious metals as well as a mix of T-Bills and high
technology stocks appear to be in order;

 - The six geese-a-laying constitutes a luxury which can no longer
be afforded. It has long been felt that the production rate of one egg
per goose per day is an example of the decline in productivity.
Three geese will be let go, and an upgrading in the selection procedure
by personnel will assure management that from now on every goose it
gets will be a good one;

 - The seven swans-a-swimming is obviously a number chosen in
better times.  The function is primarily decorative.  Mechanical swans
are on order. The current swans will be retrained to learn some new
strokes and therefore enhance their outplacement;

 - As you know, the eight maids-a-milking concept has been under
heavy scrutiny by the EEOC. A male/female balance in the workforce
is being sought. The more militant maids consider this a dead-end job
with no upward mobility. Automation of the process may permit the
maids to try a-mending, a-mentoring or a-mulching;

 - Nine ladies dancing has always been an odd number.  This function
will be phased out as these individuals grow older and can no longer
do the steps;

 - Ten Lords-a-leaping is overkill.  The high cost of Lords plus the
expense of international air travel prompted the Compensation
Committee to suggest replacing this group with ten out-of-work
congressmen.  While leaping ability may be somewhat sacrificed,
the savings are significant because we expect an oversupply of
unemployed local body politicians this year;

 - Eleven pipers piping and twelve drummers drumming is a simple
case of the band getting too big.  A substitution with a string
quartet, a cutback on new music and no uniforms will produce
savings which will drop right down to the bottom line;

We can expect a substantial reduction in assorted people, fowl,
animals and other expenses.  Though incomplete, studies indicate
that stretching deliveries over twelve days is inefficient.  If we can
drop ship in one day, service levels will be improved.

Regarding the lawsuit filed by the attorney's association seeking
expansion to include the legal profession ("thirteen lawyers-a-suing")
action is pending.

Lastly, it is not beyond consideration that deeper cuts may be
necessary in the future to stay competitive.  Should that happen,
the Board will request management to scrutinize the Snow White
Division to see if seven dwarfs is the right number.

Happy Holidays!

By Nicholas Petreley 

T'was the night before deadline when all of us groused,
Not a server was stirring, not even the mouse;
'Cause Windows was hung with a bright blue screen glare,
In need of a service pack that wasn't there. 

My vision was blurring, my face turning red,
While visions of sledgehammers danced in my head.
I put down the manual, gave it a slap.
I just can't believe that we paid for this crap. 

Then out of my trance I arose with a clatter,
I sprang from my chair to be done with the matter.
Away to the garbage I ran like a flash,
And dropped Windows disks in the festering trash. 

The goon who created this product did show
That his knowledge of software had come from below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But an OS that's free and it's free as in beer. 

With its modular drivers so stable and quick,
I knew in a moment that Linux was slick.
More rapid than DOS was the manager's claim!
But I whistled and shouted and called and exclaimed; 

"No Crashes! No Errors! No Fussin' and Fixin'!
No problems as stupid as DLL mixin'!"
So I bounced off the porch and I bounced off the wall.
No crash today, crash today, crash today! Haw!! 

Thanks to Samba the OS could run on the sly
Then the manager called me and said to stop by.
So up to the manager's office I flew,
With a fist full of disks and a manual, too. 

Just when I was thinking I'd give him my proof,
He gave me some news in a manner aloof.
As I drew back the disks and was turning around,
My hope for the future came tumbling down. 

He was dressed in all gray, from his head to his foot,
And the points in his hair o'er his ears stood a foot;
A budget immense he had put on a stack,
And he looked like a glutton done eating a snack. 

His eyes, how they squinted! His pimples, how scary!
His breath was like Marlboros, his sneer made me wary. 
His droll little brain was strung tight like a bow,
But he'd gotten the numbers he'd wanted, you know. 

Getting funds for the year was just like pulling teeth,
And the company rarely so much did bequeath.
When you grow a department and don't want to end it,
You beg money for Windows in order to spend it. 

So I knew he'd put Linux plans up on the shelf,
And I'd have to run Windows in spite of myself.
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread. 

He spoke not a word, but he showed me his work,
And he told me this year would be chock-full of perks.
And bringing this informal meeting to close,
He said no one's hurt if there's no one who knows. 

He tossed me a disk with the speed of a missile,
With a wink of an eye, and beginning to whistle. 
And I heard him exclaim, as he put fears to rest,
"We'll put Linux on all and we'll pocket the rest."

Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, 1943

"There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home."
Ken Olson, President, Digital Equipment, 1977

"Computers in the future may weigh no more than 1.5 tons."
Popular Mechanics, forecasting the relentless march of science, 1949

"But what ... is it good for?"
Engineer at the Advanced Computing Systems Division of IBM,
1968, commenting on the microchip.

with the best people, and I can assure you that data processing is a
fad that won't last out the year."

John von Neumann (ca. 1949)

"Contrasting this modest effort [of Seymour Cray in his laboratory to build
the CDC 6600] with 34 people including the janitor with our vast development
activities, I fail to understand why we have lost our industry leadership
position by letting someone else offer the world's most powerful computer."
Thomas J. Watson, IBM President, 1965

"It seems Mr. Watson has answered his own question."
Seymour Cray

"This is the rock-solid principle on which the whole of the Corporation's
[IBM's] Galaxy-wide success is founded... their fundamental design flaws are
completely hidden by their superficial design flaws."

"Computers make it easier to do a lot of things, but most of the things they
make it easier to do don't need to be done." 
Andy Rooney

"The danger from computers is not that they will eventually get as
smart as men, but that we will meanwhile agree to meet them halfway."
Bernard Avishai

"The real danger is not that computers will begin to think like men, but that
men will begin to think like machines." 
Sydney G. Harris

"In a way, staring into a computer screen is like staring into an eclipse.
It's brilliant and you don't realize the damage until its too late."
Bruce Sterling

"The most overlooked advantage to owning a computer is that if they
foul up there's no law against wacking them around a little."
Porterfield

"Imagine if every Thursday your shoes exploded if you tied them the usual way.
This happens to us all the time with computers, and nobody thinks of
complaining."
Jeff Raskin

"The most likely way for the world to be destroyed, most experts agree, is
by accident. That's where we come in; we're computer professionals. We cause
accidents."
Nathaniel Borenstein

"At the source of every error which is blamed on the computer you will
find at least two human errors, including the error of blaming it on the
computer."

it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way 
is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies."
C.A.R. Hoare

"I have a friend who told me that the greatest computer system ever built 
by mankind was by the Druids at Stonehenge. Well, that's an old story.  
But what I like was that he felt that the Druids didn't die out, they 
just went bankrupt trying to debug the software."
James Finkle

"It's a well known fact that computing devices such as the abacus were
invented thousands of years ago. But it's not well known that the first use
of a common computer protocol occured in the Old Testament. This, of course,
was when Moses aborted the Egyptians' process with a control-sea... "
Tom Galloway

"I have a cat named Trash. In the current political climate it would seem 
that if I were trying to sell him (at least to a Computer Scientist), I 
would not stress that he is gentle to humans and is self-sufficient, living 
mostly on field mice. Rather, I would argue that he is object-oriented."
Roger King

"pixel, n.: A mischievous, magical spirit associated with screen displays.
The computer industry has frequently borrowed from mythology: Witness the
sprites in computer graphics, the demons in artificial intelligence, and the
trolls in the marketing department."
Jeff Meyer

"If EasyFlow doesn't work: tough. If you lose millions because
EasyFlow messes up, it's you that's out the millions, not us. If
you don't like this disclaimer: tough. We reserve the right to do
the absolute minimum provided by law, up to and including nothing.  
This is basically the same disclaimer that comes with all software 
packages, but ours is in plain English and theirs is in legalese.  
We didn't want to include any disclaimer at all, but our lawyers insisted."
Disclaimer from Haventree Softwares's Easy Flow package

"An old puzzle asks how a barometer can be used to measure the height of a
building. Answers range from dropping the instrument from the top and
measuring the time of its fall to giving it to the building's superintendent
in return for a look at the plans. A modern version of the puzzle asks how
a personal computer can balance a checkbook. An elegant solution is to sell
the machine and deposit the money."
Jon Bentley

"The modern computer is capable of answering, in a matter of seconds, 
mathematical questions that would take millions of years for a human being 
to answer (even longer if he stopped for lunch). How does the computer do 
this? Simple. It makes everything up. It knows full well you're not going
to waste millions of years checking up on it. So you should never use 
computers for anything really important, such as balancing your personal 
checkbook. But they're fine for corporate use."

THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY:

"The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."
John Gilmore

"Usenet is like Tetris for people who still remember how to read."

of light."
Unknown

"While modern technology has given people powerful new communication
tools, it apparently can do nothing to alter the fact that many
people have nothing useful to say."
Lee Gomes, San Jose Mercury News

"The Internet is so big, so powerful and pointless that for some people
it is a complete substitute for life."
Andrew Brown

"There are three kinds of death in this world. There's heart death, there's
brain death, and there's being off the network."
Guy Almes

"In view of all the deadly computer viruses that have been spreading lately,
Weekend Update would like to remind you: when you link up to another
computer, you're linking up to every computer that that computer has ever
linked up to."
Dennis Miller, SNL Weekend Update

"The world communications net, the all-involving linkage of electric
circuitry, will grow and become more sensitive. It will also develop new
modes of feedback so that communication can become dialogue instead of
monologue. It will breach the wall between "in" and "out" of school. It
will join all people everywhere."  
Marshall McLuhan,  Learning in the Global Village, 1969

"The skeptic may be pardoned for thinking that hypertext encourages 
irrelevance. What the user can end up with is little more than a series 
of footnotes, marginalia, and "see also" references -- items that have 
historically been relegated to second-class citizenship in the good old 
book format, with the added benefit of not having to stare at a lousy 
screen display to read them... Indeed, when you boil it down to its 
rudiments, hypertext seems to make one major claim: it makes computers work 
almost as well as books."  
Stephen Manes

"You can measure a programmer's perspective by noting his attitude on
the continuing viability of Fortran."
Alan Perlis

"Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to
build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying
to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning."
Rich Cook

"The most important thing in the programming language is the name. A language
will not succeed without a good name. I have recently invented a very good
name and now I am looking for a suitable language."
D. E. Knuth

"The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be
regarded as a criminal offense."
Professor Edsger Dijkstra 

"It is practically impossible to teach good programming style to students that
have had prior exposure to BASIC; as potential programmers they are mentally
mutilated beyond hope of regeneration."
Professor Edsger Dijkstra

"As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it
wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to
be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a
large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding
mistakes in my own programs."
Maurice Wilkes discovers debugging, 1949

Real Programmers don't write in COBOL. COBOL is for wimpy applications
programmers.

Real Programmers don't write in FORTRAN. FORTRAN is for pipe stress freaks and
crystallography weenies.

Real Programmers don't write in PASCAL, or BLISS, or ADA, or any of
those pinko computer science languages. Strong typing is for people with
weak memories.

Real Programmers don't comment their code. If it was hard to write, it should
be hard to understand.

Real Programmers don't write specs -- users should consider themselves
lucky to get any programs at all and take what they get.

Real Programmers don't play tennis, or any other sport that requires you to
change clothes. Mountain climbing is OK, and real programmers wear their
climbing boots to work in case a mountain should suddenly spring up in the
middle of the machine room.

Classic Blunders of Evil Overlords

The original had no author's credits. There is a later version floating
around with a 1996 copyright by Peter Anspach, which has subtle differences
from this one. In particular, #8 is better in this version. However, his
version has many more entries, so it is included in its entirety.

     If one believes the movies, any Evil Overlord will make one of a small
     number of "Classic Blunders". This Blunder will inevitably lead to the
     downfall of the Evil Overlord (by whatever title s/he is known).

     Therefore, I have made a list of Things to Avoid, should I ever be in
     the position of Evil Overlord.

                        If I ever become an Evil Overlord:

       1. My legions of terror will have helmets with clear plexiglass
          visors, not face-concealing ones.
       2. My ventilation ducts will be too small to crawl through.
       3. My noble half-brother whose throne I usurped will be killed, not
          kept anonymously imprisoned in a forgotten cell of my dungeon.
       4. Shooting is _not_ too good for my enemies.
       5. The artifact which is the source of my power will not be kept on
          the Mountain of Despair beyond the River of Fire guarded by the
          Dragons of Eternity. It will be in my safe-deposit box.
       6. I will not gloat over my enemies' predicament before killing them.
       7. When the rebel leader challenges me to fight one-on-one and asks,
          "Or are you afraid without your armies to back you up?" My reply
          will be, "No, just sensible."
       8. When I've captured my adversary and he says, "Look, before you
          kill me, will you at least tell me what this is all about?" I'll
          shoot him, and then say "No".
       9. After I kidnap the beautiful princess, we will be married
          immediately in a quiet civil ceremony, not a lavish spectacle in
          three weeks time during which the final phase of my plan will be
          carried out.
      10. I will not include a self-destruct mechanism unless absolutely
          necessary. If it is necessary, it will not be a large red button
          labelled "Danger: Do Not Push".
      11. I will not order my trusted lieutenant to kill the infant who is
          destined to overthrow me -- I'll do it myself.
      12. I will not interrogate my enemies in the inner sanctum -- a small
          hotel well outside my borders will work just as well.
      13. I will be secure in my superiority. Therefore, I will feel no need
          to prove it by leaving clues in the form of riddles or leaving my
          weaker enemies alive to show they pose no threat.
      14. I will not waste time making my enemy's death look like an
          accident: I'm not accountable to anyone and my other enemies
          wouldn't believe it.
      15. I will make it clear that I _do_ know the meaning of the word
          "mercy"; I simply choose not show them any.
      16. One of my advisors will be an average five-year-old child. Any
          flaws in my plan that he is able to spot will be corrected before
          implementation.
      17. All slain enemies will be cremated, not left for dead at the
          bottom of the cliff. The announcement of their deaths, as well as
          any accompanying celebration, will be deferred until after the
          aforementioned disposal.
      18. My undercover agents will not have tattoos identifying them as
          members of my organization, nor will they be required to wear
          military boots or adhere to any other dress codes.
      19. The hero is not entitled to a last kiss, a last cigarette, or any
          other form of last request.
      20. I will never employ any device with a digital countdown. If I find
          that such a device is absolutely unavoidable, I will set it to
          activate when the counter reaches 117 and the hero is just putting
          his plan into operation.
      21. I will design all doomsday machines myself. If I must hire a mad
          scientist to assist me, I will make sure that he is sufficiently
          twisted to never regret his evil ways and seek to undo the damage
          he's caused.
      22. I will never utter the sentence "But before I kill you, there's
          just one thing I want to know."
      23. When I employ people as advisors, I will occasionally listen to
          their advice. (End of original, start of new section)
      24. I will not have a son. Although his laughably under-planned
          attempt to usurp power would easily fail, it would provide a fatal
          distraction at a crucial point in time.
      25. I will not have a daughter. She would be as beautiful as she was
          evil, but one look at the hero's rugged countenance and she'd
          betray her own father.
      26. Despite its proven stress-relieving effect, I will not indulge in
          maniacal laughter. When so occupied, it's too easy to miss
          unexpected developments that a more attentive individual could
          adjust to accordingly.
      27. I will hire a talented fashion designer to create original
          uniforms for my legions of terror, as opposed to some cheap
          knock-offs that make them look like Nazi stormtroopers, Roman
          footsoldiers, or savage Mongol hordes. All were eventually
          defeated and I want my troops to have a more positive mind-set.
      28. No matter how tempted I am with the prospect of unlimited power, I
          will not consume any energy field bigger than my head.
      29. I will keep a special cache of low-tech weapons and train my
          troops in their use. That way -- even if the heroes manage to
          neutralize my power generator and/or render the standard-issue
          energy weapons useless -- my troops will not be overrun by a
          handful of savages armed with spears and rocks.
      30. I will maintain a realistic assessment of my strengths and
          weaknesses. Even though this takes some of the fun out of the job,
          at least I will never utter the line "No, this cannot be! I AM
          INVINCIBLE!!!" (After that, death is usually instantaneous.)
      31. No matter how well it would perform, I will never construct any
          sort of machinery which is completely indestructable except for
          one small and virtually inaccessible vulnerable spot.
      32. If I am engaged in a duel to the death with the hero and I am
          fortunate enough to knock the weapon out of his hand, I will
          graciously allow him to retrieve it. This is not from a sense of
          fair play; rather, he will be so startled and confused that I will
          easily be able to dispatch him.
      33. No matter how attractive certain members of the rebellion are,
          there is probably someone just as attractive who is not desperate
          to kill me. Therefore, I will think twice before ordering a
          prisoner sent to my bedchamber.
      34. I will never build only one of anything important. For the same
          reason I will always carry at least two fully loaded weapons at
          all times.
      35. If my supreme command center comes under attack, I will
          immediately flee to safety in my prepared escape pod and direct
          the defenses from there. I will not wait until the troops break
          into my inner sanctum to attempt this.
      36. My pet monster will be kept in a secure cage from which it cannot
          escape and into which I could not accidentally stumble.
      37. Even though I don't really care because I plan on living forever,
          I will hire engineers who are able to build me a fortress sturdy
          enough that, if I am slain, it won't tumble to the ground for no
          good structural reason.
      38. I will dress in bright and cheery colors, and so throw my enemies
          into confusion.
      39. All bumbling conjurers, clumsy squires, no-talent bards, and
          cowardly thieves in the land will be pre-emptively put to death.
          My foes will surely give up and abandon their quest if they have
          no source of comic relief.
      40. All naive, busty tavern wenches in my realm will be replaced with
          surly, world-weary waitresses who will provide no unexpected
          reinforcement and/or romantic subplot for the hero or his
          sidekick.
      41. Any and all magic and/or technology that can miraculously
          resurrect a secondary character who has given up his/her life
          through self sacrifice will be outlawed and destroyed.
      42. I will not fly into a rage and kill a messenger who brings me bad
          news just to illustrate how evil I really am. Good messengers are
          hard to come by.
      43. I will see to it that plucky young lads/lasses in strange clothes
          and with the accent of an outlander shall REGULARLY climb some
          monument in the main sqaure of my capital and denounce me, claim
          to know the secret of my power, rally the masses to rebellion,
          etc. That way, the citizens will be jaded in case the real thing
          ever comes along.
      44. I won't require high-ranking female members of my organization to
          wear a stainless-steel bustier. Morale is better with a more
          casual dress-code. Similarly, outfits made entirely from black
          leather will be reserved for formal occasions.
      45. I will not employ devious schemes that involve the hero's party
          getting into my inner sanctum before the trap is sprung.
      46. I will not turn into a snake. It never helps.
      47. I will not grow a goatee. In the old days they made you look
          diabolic. Now they just make you look like a disaffected member of
          Generation X.
      48. I will not imprison members of the same party in the same cell
          block, let alone the same cell. If they are important prisoners, I
          will keep the only key to the cell door on my person instead of
          handing out copies to every bottom-rung guard in the prison.
      49. If my trusted lieutenant tells me my Legions of Terror are losing
          a battle, I will believe him. After all, he's my trusted
          lieutenant.
      50. If an enemy I have just killed has a younger sibling or offspring
          anywhere, I will find them and have them killed immediately,
          instead of waiting for them to grow up harboring feelings of
          vengance towards me in my old age.
      51. If I absolutely must ride into battle, I will certainly not ride
          at the forefront of my Legions of Terror, nor will I seek out my
          opposite number among his army.
      52. I will be neither chivalrous nor sporting. If I have an
          unstoppable superweapon, I will use it as early and as often as
          possible instead of keeping it in reserve.
      53. Once my power is secure, I will destroy all those pesky
          time-travel devices.
      54. I will offer oracles the choice of working exclusively for me or
          being executed.
      55. When I capture the hero, I will make sure I also get his dog,
          monkey, ferret, or whatever sickeningly cute little animal capable
          of untying ropes and filching keys happens to follow him around.
      56. I will maintain a healthy amount of skepticism when I capture the
          beautiful rebel and she claims she is attracted to my power and
          good looks and will gladly betray her companions if I just let her
          in on my plans.
      57. I will only employ bounty hunters who work for money. Those who
          work for the pleasure of the hunt tend to do dumb things like even
          the odds to give the other guy a sporting chance.
      58. I will not rely entirely upon "totally reliable" spells that can
          be neutralized by relatively inconspicuous talismen.
      59. I will make sure I have a clear understanding of who is
          responsible for what in my organization. For example, if my
          general screws up I will not draw my weapon, point it at him, say
          "And here is the price for failure," then suddenly turn and kill
          some random underling.
      60. If an advisor says to me "My liege, he is but one man. What can
          one man possibly do?", I will reply "This." and kill the advisor.
      61. If I learn that a callow youth has begun a quest to destroy me, I
          will slay him while he is still a callow youth instead of waiting
          for him to mature.
      62. I will treat any beast which I control through magic or technology
          with respect and kindness. Thus if the control is ever broken, it
          will not immediately come after me for revenge.
      63. If I learn the whereabouts of the one artifact which can destroy
          me, I will not send all my troops out to seize it. Instead I will
          send them out to seize something else and quietly put a Want-Ad in
          the local paper.
      64. My main computers will have their own special operating system
          that will be completely incompatable with standard IBM and
          Macintosh powerbooks.
      65. I will make the main entrance to my fortress standard-sized. While
          elaborate 60-foot high double-doors definitely impress the masses,
          they are hard to close quickly in an emergency.
      66. If one of my dungeon guards begins expressing concern over the
          conditions in the beautiful princess' cell, I will immediately
          transfer him to a less people-oriented position.
      67. I will hire a team of board-certified architects and surveyors to
          examine my castle and inform me of any secret passages and
          abandoned tunnels that I might not know about.
      68. If the beautiful princess that I capture says "I'll never marry
          you! Never, do you hear me, NEVER!!!", I will say "Oh well" and
          kill her.
      69. I will not strike a bargain with a demonic being then attempt to
          double-cross it simply because I feel like being contrary.
      70. Finally, to keep my subjects permanently locked in a mindless
          trance, I will provide each of them with free unlimited Internet
          access.


  50 WAYS TO CONFUSE, WORRY, OR JUST SCARE THE BEJEEZUS OUT OF         
                  PEOPLE IN THE COMPUTER LAB  

1.  Log on, wait a sec, then get a frightened look on your face 
    and scream "Oh my God!  They've found me!" and bolt.

2.  Laugh uncontrollably for about 3 minutes & then suddenly stop
    and look suspiciously at everyone who looks at you.

3.  When your computer is turned off, complain to the monitor on
    duty that you can't get the damn thing to work.  After 
    he/she's turned it on, wait 5 minutes, turn it off again, & 
    repeat the process for a good half hour.

4.  Type frantically, often stopping to look at the person next 
    to you evilly.

5.  Before anyone else is in the lab, connect each computer to
    different screen than the one it's set up with.
           
6.  Write a program that plays the "Smurfs" theme song and play 
    it at the highest volume possible over & over again.

7.  Work normally for a while. Suddenly look amazingly startled 
    by something on the screen and crawl underneath the desk.

8.  Ask the person next to you if they know how to tap into
    top-secret Pentagon files.

9.  Use Interactive Send to make passes at people you don't know.

10.  Make a small ritual sacrifice to the computer before you 
     turn it on.

11.  Bring a chainsaw, but don't use it. If anyone asks why you 
     have it, say "Just in case..." mysteriously.

12.  Type on VAX for a while.  Suddenly start cursing for 3 
     minutes at everything bad about your life.  Then stop and 
     continue typing.

13.  Enter the lab, undress, and start staring at other people as
     if they're crazy while typing.

14.  Light candles in a pentagram around your terminal before
     starting.

15.  Ask around for a spare disk.  Offer $2.  Keep asking until
     someone agrees. Then, pull a disk out of your fly and say, 
     "Oops, I forgot."

16.  Every time you press Return and there is processing time
     required, pray "Ohpleaseohpleaseohpleaseohplease," and 
     scream "YES!" when it finishes.

17.  "DISK FIGHT!!!"

18.  Start making out with the person at the terminal next to you    
     (It helps if you know them, but this is also a great way to
     make new friends).

19.  Put a straw in your mouth and put your hands in your 
     pockets.  Type by hitting the keys with the straw.

20.  If you're sitting in a swivel chair, spin around singing 
     "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" whenever there is processing time     
     required. 

21.  Draw a pictue of a woman (or man) on a piece of paper, tape 
     it to your monitor.  Try to seduce it.  Act like it hates 
     you and then complain loudly that women (men) are worthless.

22.  Try to stick a Nintendo cartridge into the 3 1/2 disc   
     drive, when it doesn't work, get the supervisor.

23.  When you are on an IBM, and when you turn it on, ask loudly
     where the smiling Apple face is when you turn on one of 
     those.

24.  Print out the complete works of Shakespeare, then when its 
     all done (two days later) say that all you wanted was one 
     line.

25.  Sit and stare at the screen, biting your nails noisely.  
     After doing this for a while, spit them out at the feet of 
     the person next to you.

26.  Stare at the screen, grind your teeth, stop, look at the 
     person next to grinding.  Repeat procedure, making sure you
     never provoke the person enough to let them blow up, as this
     releases tension, and it is far more effective to let them 
     linger.

27.  If you have long hair, take a typing break, look for split
     ends, cut them and deposit them on your neighbor's keyboard
     as you leave.

28.  Put a large, gold-framed portrait of the British Royal 
     Family on your desk and loudly proclaim that it inspires 
     you.

29.  Come to the lab wearing several layers of socks.  Remove 
     shoes and place them of top of the monitor.  Remove socks 
     layer by layer and drape them around the monitor.  Exclaim 
     sudden haiku about the aesthetic beauty of cotton on 
     plastic.

30.  Take the keyboard and sit under the computer.  Type up your
     paper like this.  Then go to the lab supervisor and complain
     about the bad working conditions. 

31.  Laugh hysterically, shout "You will all perish in flames!!!"
     and continue working.

32.  Bring some dry ice & make it look like your computer is 
     smoking.

33.  Assign a musical note to every key (ie. the Delete key is A
     Flat, the B key is F sharp, etc.).  Whenever you hit a key,
     hum its note loudly. Write an entire paper this way.

34.  Attempt to eat your computer's mouse.

     "Excuse me, mind if I borrow this for a sec?", unplugging 
     the keyboard & taking it.

36.  Bring in a bunch of magnets and have fun.  

37.  When doing calculations, pull out an abacus and say that
     sometimes the old ways are best.

38.  Play Pong for hours on the most powerful computer in the 
     lab.

39.  Make a loud noise of hitting the same key over and over 
     again until you see that your neighbor is noticing (You can 
     hit the space bar so your fill isn't affected).  Then look 
     at your neighbor's keyboard.  Hit his/her delete key several
     times, erasing an entire word.  While you do this, ask:
     "Does *your* delete key work?"  Shake your head, and resume
     hitting the space bar on your keyboard.  Keep doing this 
     until you've deleted about a page of your neighbor's 
     document.  Then, suddenly exclaim: "Well, whaddya know? I've
     been hitting the space bar this whole time. No wonder it 
     wasn't deleting! Ha!"  Print out your document and leave.

40.  Remove your disk from the drive and hide it.  Go to the lab
     monitor and complain that your computer ate your disk.  (For
     special effects, put some Elmer's Glue on or around the disk
     drive.  Claim that the computer is drooling.)

41.  Stare at the person's next to your's screen, look really
     puzzled, burst out laughing, and say "You did that?" loudly.    
     Keep laughing, grab your stuff and leave, howling as you go.
        
42.  Point at the screen.  Chant in a made up language while 
     making elaborate hand gestures for a minute or two.  Press 
     return or the mouse, then leap back and yell 
     "COVEEEEERRRRRR!"  peek up from under the table, walk back 
     to the computer and say.  "Oh, good.  It worked this time," 
     and calmly start to type again.

43.  Keep looking at invisible bugs and trying to swat them.

44.  See who's online.  Send a total stranger a talk request.  
     Talk to them like you've known them all your lives.  Hangup     
     before they get a chance to figure out you're a total 
     stranger.

45.  Bring an small tape player with a tape of really absurd sound
     effects.  Pretend it's the computer and look really lost.

46.  Pull out a pencil.  Start writing on the screen.  Complain 
     that the lead doesn't work.

47.  Come into the computer lab wearing several endangered 
     species of flowers in your hair.  Smile incessantly.  Type a
     sentence, then laugh happily, exclaim "You're such a
     marvel!!", and kiss the screen.  Repeat this after every
     sentence.  As your ecstasy mounts, also hug the keyboard. 
     Finally, hug your neighbor, then the computer assistant, and
     walk out.

48.  Run into the computer lab, shout "Armageddon is here!!!!!",
     then calmly sit down and begin to type.

49.  Quietly walk into the computer lab with a Black and Decker
     chainsaw, rev that baby up, and then walk up to the nearest
     person and say "Give me that computer or you'll be feeding
     my pet crocodile for the next week".

50.  Two words:  Tesla Coil.

  Test-tube triplets were born in Texas recently--probably the only state where

	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Reagan says he's engaged in "quiet diplomacy" with the Soviets, and we
gather that means more than that he's simply turned the volume down on his
hearing aid.
  A new poll shows most Democrats want a Mondale-Hart ticket.  That should
pretty well snuff out the chances of it happening.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  There's also been talk of Fritz Mondale running with Lee Iacocca.  Hmmmmm.
Ethnically, can Democrats geP`eway with two candidates whose last names end in

	  <<<<***>>>>
  Analysts think a Mondale-Hart ticket is possible.  Makes sense.  It'd give Mr.
Mondale confidence that Mr. Hart would never be heard from again.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The Hart and Mondale folks have been talking informally to see if they can
make a deal, it's reported.  The good news so far is they've apparently agreed

leaders about a running mate doesn't mean he'll select a woman.

  Gary Hart won 28 primaries or caucuses, compared with 24 for Fritz Mondale, it

  If states don't raise the drinking age to 21 they'll lose federal highway

	  <<<<***>>>>
  Raising the drinking age to 21 but keeping the voting age at 18 means citizens
have just three years in which they legally must be sober to cast a ballot.

  Only men--56 of them--signed the Declaration of Independence. It's amazing how

  A new study says kids should start school at age 4.  Think what that could

  Congress has approved an increase in the national debt ceiling.  The
surprising thing is there are reporters and editors who still think this is
news.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The Senate passed the debt ceiling hike with no debate. Just as well.  It's
already been talked to debt.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Still, the housing price rise means we've been able to get into a high-priced
neighborhood without even moving.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Maybe Fritz Mondale, under increasing pressure to pick a woman running mate,
could satisfy everyone by naming Lee Hart.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  If Mr. Mondale wants a woman veep who's well known and who has been close to
the center of power he might ask Nancy Reagan.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The current best bet for a woman veep is Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of Queens.
Luckily for her she's not from Kings.

  Diane Sawyer will join "60 Minutes" this fall or winter. And it won't be long

  The presidential campaign has been draining.	In fact, it will come as no
surprise to learn that Fritz Mondale is looking for a walking mate.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Sen. Lloyd Bentsen is getting lots of ink as a possible running mate for Fritz
Mondale. He's come a long way.  We remember when he was just an aide to a
governor on a TV show.

  Man-made pollution has been deteriorating forests in the eastern U.S. for more

  A Marine general says conventional war with the Soviets is "almost
inevitable." So should we hurry up and start one before one starts itself?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Reagan disagrees that conventional war with the Soviets is nearly
inevitable. What's the bad news?  That a nuclear one is?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  If you want the truth, all this controversy about whether there should be
leaded gasoline exhausts us.

  The Reagan-Bush campaign reports having a surplus of more than $10 million.
Can't we hire the campaign manager as federal budget director?

  The most recent figures show Gary Hart's campaign nearly $5 million in debt.
That's the kind of debt you almost have to be an ex-president to afford.

  The Supreme Court decision on televising college football games is a bit

  These disputes between baseball managers and umpires slow down our reading of
the paper too much.  We have to pause to translate all the (bleeps).

  Inspired by a current movie, we're thinking of starting a company that will

  Imagine how Gerry Ferraro's mother feels.  She sacrifices to give her daughter
everything, but when the child grows up she gets picked for a job attending
foreign funerals.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  We suppose now we should be ready for endless joke reruns that will go
something like: "Who was that lady I saw you with?"  "That was no lady, that was
my vice president."
	  <<<<***>>>>
  How can Geraldine Ferraro help balance the ticket?  Why, we bet Fritz Mondale
outweighs her by 80 pounds.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  To people who say women shouldn't work outside the home, Ms. Ferraro can say,
"I won't be.  I'll be vice president, remember?"
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Rep. Ferraro's husband is John Zaccaro, a real estate developer.  Do we need
anyone in Washington who could turn the White House into a condo?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Geraldine Ferraro's husband no doubt now is preparing for the inevitable
questions about his favorite recipes.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "My parents are so in love with each other it is sickening," says Ms.
Ferraro's daughter, Donna.  But can their marriage withstand Mr. Zaccaro having
the only real job in the family?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  If nothing else, a Mondale-Ferraro ticket will outsyllable a Reagan-Bush
ticket by two.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Rep. Ferraro is a lawyer.  She could get elected by a large majority if only
fellow lawyers voted for her.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Bella Abzug says having Ms. Ferraro on the ticket will be "a whole new step in
American history."  We're still waiting to find out what it was taken in.  A
Naturalizer, maybe?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  There are three children in the Ferraro-Zaccaro family: Donna, John and Laura.
 You have to feel good about a country in which kids can aspire to follow in
their mother's footsteps.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The congressional district Gerry Ferraro represents is the one Archie Bunker
supposedly lives in.  We're glad Fritz Mondale didn't pick Edith.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Our friend Orly says he figures Mr. Mondale put Ms. Ferraro on the ticket just
to help him skirt more issues.

  Aunt Ilse from Oelwein calls to say she hopes everyone in Dallas had fun at

  Some folks in Washington, D.C., are paying up to $20,8 to own a parking

  The national average price of a new single-family home now is more than
$100,000.  Maybe folks saving for a downpayment should be more concerned about
the UPpayment.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Still, the housing price rise means we've been able to get into a high-priced
neighborhood without even moving.
  The Hart and Jackson forces tried to change parts of the platform but failed
to get through a plank that calls Fritz Mondale a nerd.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  A political party's platform, by the way, is the document that tells where
delegates stand, besides in the aisles.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Jesse Jackson says the main reason for holding the convention is to adopt a
platform.  Then why didn't he leave when that was done?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  More evidence Mr. Jackson doesn't understand the system: He took it as a
put-down when Mr. Mondale didn't consider him for veep.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Gerry Ferraro says she wants to debate George Bush.  It'll give both a chance
to get an edge in wordwise.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  A poll shows most folks think Mr. Mondale chose Ms. Ferraro because of
pressure from women's groups.  Sounds like a put down of the Italian-American,
Catholic and size 7 shoe lobbies.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The Democratic platform runs 35,000 words.  Divided by the number of people
who'll ever read it all, that's about 1,000 words each.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The man at the next desk says he can't attend a party at our house next Friday

  Overheard on our bus:  "I'm feeling more independent these days.  In the last

	  <<<<***>>>>
  As we understand the new rules, we won't have to have automatic seat belts or
air bags installed in our easy chair to be able to watch next month's Republican
convention on TV.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  We'll install an air bag in our car, but only if automatic seat belts are
required on all congressional seats.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  All cars might have to have air bags or automatic safety harnesses by 1990
under new federal rules.  We still think an easier answer would be to make cars
out of Nerf.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  We were surprised that the Democratic convention's start wasn't delayed for
Mondale veep interviews with George Brett, Gary Carter, Dale Murphy, Dwight
Gooden and Fernando Valenzuela.

  Gary Hart said if he got nominated he'd also have picked Geraldine Ferraro as
a running mate.  And can we expect Harold Stassen soon to name George Bush?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  From what we could tell, the delegates kissed Fritz Mondale and hoped he'd
change into a decent frog disguise.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  This was the 39th Democratic convention.  Which just proves that it used to be
possible to get nominated without Walter Cronkite there to watch.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "It is essential that Ronald Reagan be defeated," Mr. Mondale says.  Not if
taxpayers want to avoid supporting another former president.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "If July brings back Anne Gorsuch Burford," Gov. Mario Cuomo asks, "what can
we expect of December?"  Gee, we were sort of hoping for Santa Claus.

  Moscone Hall is said to be the world's largest column-free room.  Which did
not, obviously, mean columnist free.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Attending the Democratic convention were 3,933 delegates and 1,303
alternates-- two or three dozen of whom were in their seats at any one time.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The Manatt-Lance turmoil showed that although Mr. Mondale may be indecisive at
least it's in a decisive way.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The only groups we didn't see demonstrating in the streets of San Francisco
were the Pro Apathy Party and the Street Cleaners Union.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Our kids were disappointed to learn that San Francisco's cable cars aren't

	  <<<<***>>>>
  "Doonesbury" will be back this fall.  And it's unclear whether this country
can handle both a presidential and a Zonker Harris tanning campaign.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Although picking Gerry Ferraro was a bold move for Mr. Mondale, an even bolder
one would have been to pick Jane Wyman.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  As they began their convention, the Democrats seemed unified.  At least
everyone seems to have found someone else to dislike.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  For some perverse reason, we can't wait to see the first Ferraro bumper
sticker on a Ferrari.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "This is an exciting choice," Fritz Mondale says of Gerry Ferraro.  Well,
relatively. More exciting than Lloyd Bentsen, but less than Dolly Parton.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  In Congress, Rep. Ferraro has been an advocate of noise control measures.  We
hope she'll have some influence in that area in the campaign.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  After she got married, Gerry Ferraro kept her maiden name as a tribute to her
mother.  It's further evidence of how she balances the ticket. Mr. Mondale kept
his to honor his father.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "American history is about doors being opened," says Gerry Ferraro.  And
sometimes about finding skeletons in the closets behind them.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "Vice president has such a nice ring to it," says Ms. Ferraro.  Further
evidence she's got a lot to learn about how government works.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The DeLorean trial, like the baseball season, is into its second half.  So far
we know of no plans at the trial to hold some kind of All-Star game.
  You knew the Democrats eventually would unite behind a ticket.  After all,
deep disunity is hard to maintain.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Aunt Ilse from Oelwein wonders why no one thinks Mr. Mondale has a chance to
beat Mr. Reagan. "Any country that can choose old," she writes, "can just as
easily choose boring."
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "What this ticket is all about is not what America can do for women but what
women can do for America," says Gerry Ferraro. That really sounds quite
Kennedyesque--Jackie.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The big question facing Democrats now is whether Gerry Ferraro's coattails are
long enough to carry Fritz Mondale into office with her.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Another unanswered question is whether anyone has ever come back to win the
presidency after, at his nominating convention, New Jersey put him over the top.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  With the convention in San Francisco, Democrats must have been glad their
nominees didn't ride off into the sunset, no matter how well they swim.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "The question," George McGovern told delegates, "is where will America be four
years from now?"  Personally, we hope it's still somewhere between Mexico and
Canada.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "Promises are cheap," Gary Hart said in his convention speech.  And it was
good to find out SOMETHING is.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Democrats proved they can't be trusted with our future when they stood up at
their convention and cheered at the word "infrastructure."
	  <<<<***>>>>
  At the Hart demonstration on the convention floor there were more Yuppies than
at a wine tasting party at a BMW dealership.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "The stakes in 1984 couldn't be higher," Senator Hart said, failing, however,
to comment on any of the cheaper cuts or chicken.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The vision from the floor must have been terrible.  Delegates kept shouting
"We want Hart!" when he was right there on the podium.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  For a time during the convention, the only certainty was that the Democrats
wouldn't nominate a Simpson-Mazzoli ticket.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  A quiet movement to dump Bert Lance developed at the convention.  And we'll be
interested to see if it's possible for Mr. Mondale to reconsider this matter and
make any more firm indecisions.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Ted Kennedy Jr. addressed the convention, too.  Is there a law against a
father-son presidential ticket?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  For as much labor support as Fritz Mondale has, it has been odd to see
thousands of Democrats in San Francisco off work all week.
	  <<<<***>>>>
"As president," Fritz Mondale says, "I will work for peace from my first day in
office, not from my first day of campaigning for office, not from my first day
of campaigning for re-election." For most presidents they're the same day.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  This may be a dirty presidential campaign, with Democrats showing old movies
of Mr. Reagan hanging around Bonzo and Republicans showing footage of Mr.
Mondale hanging around Jimmy Carter.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Gerry Ferraro says she and Fritz Mondale will prove the experts wrong.  Not
much of a challenge.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Anothe reason the last day of the Democratic convention was an historic day is
that TV reporters set a world record for saying it was an historic day.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Barbara Hubbard, an anti-nuclear activist, also was nominated for veep at the
Democratic convention.	But she withdrew, preferring to lose now rather than in
November.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "I've put my share of criminals behind bars," Ms. Ferraro said.  Did she
sponsor a program for folks in jail to learn to be bartenders?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "There are no doors we cannot unlock," says Gerry Ferraro. What will this
administration do?  Hire car thieves?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  It would have been even more interesting if the platform floor fights had
been, instead, mud wrestling.
  Updated version of the annual song:  "Bare she is, Miss America.  .  .  "
	  <<<<***>>>>
  All this controversy about Miss America posing nude is too bad, but we're at
least glad it wasn't Bert Parks.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Congress is back in session. It must want to give delegates to the upcoming
Republican convention more things to denounce.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  One good way to pay disgruntled postal workers but delay the financial crunch
on the Postal Service indefinitely would be to mail their checks.
 }i	    <<<<***>>>>
  The latest Gallup poll shows Mr. Mondale leading Mr. Reagan by 2 percentage
points.  Of course, current standings show the Cubs still in the pennant race,
too.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The syndicated wizards are slow.  None has yet pondered Ferraronomics.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Mondale plans to kick off his campaign in the South, it's reported.  To
this ticket, however, the South may mean South Bend.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Economists now are worried about deflation.  Inflation, deflation,
stagflation.  We pine for the good old days of just plain flation.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The Israeli election showed one thing:  Analysts who said they weren't sure
what would happen hit it right on the mark.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Mondale says he'd raise taxes if elected and says Mr. Reagan will too.  If
he's going to base this campaign on truth and candor he's got even less chance
than we thought.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Democrats are pinning their presidential hopes on massive voter registration
drives. That, and possibly divine intervention.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  We have a new Miss America, though she'll get to serve barely a month.  Uh,
let us rephrase that...
	  <<<<***>>>>
  You'd think the least "Penthouse" magazine could do is donate profits from its
September issue to the Miss America scholarship fund.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Our minister, Pastor Deluge, says it would be better if there were at least
equal interest in photos that might be published in "Repenthouse" magazine.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  How long do you suppose it will be before the Miss America pageant asks Bob
Guccione to be a judge?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  We admit we looked at the nude photos of Miss America.  In fact, to reach the
proper level of disgust we had to look at them several times.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mexico City, with 16 million people already, is expected to double by the turn

  ABC may have a bigger Olympic audience than expected.  Fans in the stands may

  Mr. Reagan has ended the ban on Soviet fishing in U.S. waters.  But what can

  Researchers studying moon rock disagree on whether the moon once was a part of

  A California man just filed for his 26th divorce.  You couldn't get us to do

  Jobs for this year's college graduates are easier to find, it's reported.
Must be a big demand for overqualified people.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Reagan says he can't understand why interest rates are so high.  Well, an
old editor of ours always said that when we couldn't understand something we
should look for the part money plays in it.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  A 5-year-old Lebanese girl, Re Mi Bendaly, is gaining fame singing anti-war
ballads.  It's what you get when you ask, "Want to make some dough, Re Mi?"
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The Democrats seem slow on the draw.	Though Mr. Re@San has accused them of
demagoguery, they've failed to charge him with republigoguery.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Mondale calls Mr. Reagan's statement that he has no plans for a tax
increase a "fish story."  It looks as if this campaign will be no different from
most others:  carp, carp, carp.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  As we read current polls, we'd guess we'll either have two presidents come
January or none at all.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Republicans are finding it a delicate job to run against Gerry Ferraro.  It's
hard for them to know whether to be on the offense, defense or simply the fence.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  As we get it, GOP strategy will be to depict Ms. Ferraro as a candidatette.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  At least we're grateful that so far we haven't heard anyone singing the theme
song from "Annie" substituting "Ferraro" for "tomorrow."
	  <<<<***>>>>
  If Mr. Mondale loses this fall, of course, BOTH parties will face wide-open
primaries in 1988, and maybe you should think about whether you want that on
YOUR conscience.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  George Bush calls Democrats the "party of the far-out liberal Democrats."
Sounds like the kind that requires extra beer and bean dip.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "I have no plans for a tax increase," Mr. Reagan says. Like some other things
will it happen without planning?

  A nativity scene can't be set up in front of the Birmingham, Mich., City Hall
unless it's displayed with other secular symbols, a judge has ruled. Like Santa

  There've been many minuses recently for the Miss America pageant but officials
are working to destroy those negatives.  Isn't that what Vanessa Williams should
have done?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Gerry Ferraro says she considers herself a fiscal conservative.  Similarly,
Ronald Reagan once considered himself an actor.

  Secretary Regan didn't like the federal rescue of that big Illinois bank, but

  "American women come in all colors," says Gerry Ferraro.  So does their hair,
including some shades not found in nature.

  A new survey shows girls are less interested than boys in becoming president.
More evidence of innately higher female intelligence.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Researchers say granola, bananas and raisins are high on the list of snacks
that cause tooth decay.  Still, they taste better than fluoridated flossburgers.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Gerry Ferraro says we don't need government on our backs "but on every
citizen's side." These metaphors are getting under foot.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Sudan's president has ruled a convicted robber and murderer there is to be
crucified.  The president was upholding another ruling, so he was just
co-Pilate.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  China has a growing rabid dog problem, it's reported.  Wow! And think how many
Pekinese there are there.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  We've tried to stick by our resolution not to comment on football until it's
football weather.  But by then the pro season would be half over.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "I don't look at those kind of pictures," Mr. Reagan says of the 8ptnthouse"
Miss America issue.  Apparently he doesn't consider this a privates sector
intiative.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Gerry Ferraro expects a "nasty, personal campaign."  Oh, we bet she's just
saying that so we'll pay attention.
  Before this country adopts a balanced budget constitutional amendment it
should find out how much more that would throw the budget out of balance.

  We're still waiting for a pro athlete to say the biggest thrill of his career

  Scientists think a shower of comets could destroy mankind in about 15 million
years.	No help.  That's 14,999,967 years AFTER our mortgage will be paid.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The world would be less contentious if we gave others the same slack in all
matters that we give ourselves in getting through yellow lights.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Ever notice you can't be in the political mainstream without being all wet?

  If you still have a few holiday fruitcakes hanging around, here's a good
suggestion:  They make great bookends.

  In case you're doing some early Christmas shopping and have a member of the
National Rifle Association on your list, here's an idea:  A cartridge in a pear
tree.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Another tip for voters as the election approaches:  Don't vote for any
candidate who, when he came to your door to campaign, set off your burglar
alarm.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  We're still waiting for the first truly honest political billboard that will
say, in small type:  "Paid for by the special interest groups that own this
candidate."
	  <<<<***>>>>
  We look forward to September because of the much prettier color of weeds in
our yard.

  The wise college student is thinking now about getting to campus--to get

  Solidarity continues to be a problem for the Polish government, and any day
now we expect it to change that old communist rally line to, "Workers of the
world, shut up!" (Editor's note:  Bill is finally back at work after his cross
country sojourn.  We promise he won't take another vacation until, at the
earliest, December.  It's a tough life...)
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "Ronald Reagan actually seems to be getting younger," Rep. Jack Kemp told the
GOP convention.  Further evidence of what lots of sleep will do for you.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Americans are such optimists. To clear away national problems they elect
political parties that can't even clear their own convention aisles.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "This is not the president's platform," says his daughter Maureen.  So, though
he may run on it, he'll probably do so wearing track spikes.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  One reason Geraldine Ferraro got in trouble is hat on a disclosure form she
apparently checked the wrong box.  Which reminds us:  Wasn't there once an
Olympic fighter disqualified because he boxed the wrong Czech?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  There were lots of "Kemp '88" signs in the GOP convention hall.  At least
we've got four years of warning.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The GOP platform says the U.S. should think about returning to the gold
standard. Why not go all the way and return to the bead and trinket standard?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Republicans approved their most conservative platform since 1964.  Apparently
extremism in the defense of boredom is no vice.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  One reason lots of Republicans won't be running on the GOP platform is that in
a few days most won't even remember where they put their copy.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Let's see if we've got this: The GOP right is in the center of what's left of
what the moderates thought was right before many of them left because the center
moved too far right. Right?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Our guess is that Geraldine Ferraro will survive politically as long as Bob
Guccione of "Penthouse" magazine doesn't get involved.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "Our record is strong on women's issues," says George Bush.  And Aunt Ilse
agrees. She says she can smell it all the way up in Oelwein.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "Four more years," GOP delegates shouted while Gerald Ford was speaking to the
convention, but he had the good sense to stop talking after just a few weeks.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The "Agnew-for-President" boom seemed pretty low-key in Dallas.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Elizabeth Dole predicts most women will vote for Mr. Reagan. If anyone
remembers her statement after Nov. 6 it may become known as the gender gaffe.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "Talk, unlike the Democratic platform, is cheap," Bob Dole told the
convention.  Obviously he hasn't seen OUR phone bill.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Lots of women were in the GOP convention spotlight.  They were the ones
wearing name tags that said, "Hi!  My name isn't Gerry Ferraro."
	  <<<<***>>>>
  This GOP convention was concerned with great issues: the future of mankind,
world peace and whether John Zaccaro is a nerd.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The Republican platform again fails to support the ERA.  So the GOP can
correctly claim it has treated women equally for two straight elections.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  We're not sure who was in charge of testing the podium microphones at the
convention but we're pretty sure who didn't have that job.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Reagan's aides say he'll campaign three to five days a week until the
election.  Why are they cutting him back two to four days?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Democrats say Mr. Reagan has a secret plan to raise taxes.  Big deal.  Even if
he does, our system requires him eventually to leak the news to Congress.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Experts say 53 percent of the voters in November will be women.  Not only is
there a gender gap but also, apparently, an apathy gap.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Reagan currently leads Mr. Mondale by 10 to 15 points in the polls.  And
even more in the calendars.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  No, GOP doesn't stand for Gipper, Our President.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The median household income for the GOP delegates is $52,700, compared with
$20,000 for the average U.S. family.  So if you take a Republican to lunch, make
him pick up the tab.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Reagan got lots of applause at the convention for the economic recovery.
His economists, meanwhile, will continue trying to figure out what he did right.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Security for the GOP convention was reported to be tight.  That's awful.  We
hope they sobered up before anything serious happened.
  Republicans are confident, but this presidential election looks like a snap
for the Democrats. All they have to do is get the votes of anyone who's ever
messed up on his taxes.
	 4xjbbRSSssss/|
  No doubt it comes from watching the Olympics so much, but after each GOP
speaker we waited for a scoreboard to flash "6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 6.5..."
	  <<<<***>>>>
  As we read the GOP delegates, there were conservatives, conserveratives and
conservistatives.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "The Republican party has never been closer together," says George Bush.  He's
right, judging by the look of the aisles.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Bush strikes us as the sort of Texan that John Connally is a Republican.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Senator Laxalt nominated Mr. Reagan.	Why does his name always sound to us
like a low-sodium diet?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Let the Republicans worry about the future of the world. We're just glad to
discover, via our postcard mail, that spotted fawns still have a presence in
Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "We're not a per/+fect party," says Bob Dole.  How can he expect the president
to win with that kind of damaging insider revelation?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  If Democrats had nominated Jesse Jackson for veep, the GOP speakers would have
been, uh, well.  .  .  give us time and maybe we'll think of some famous black
Republicans.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The GOP has continuity.  In support of the Great Communicator the keynoter was
the Mediocre Communicator.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Jeane Kirkpatrick, who spoke to the GOP meeting, is a Democrat.  Mr. Reagan
used to be one, too.  And, though there was no evidence of it at the convention,
Mr. Nixon used to be a Republican.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  In 1980, said Jeane Kirkpatrick, Americans elected "a very different
president." Right.  No previous one had ever co-starred with Bonzo.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Ford spoke to the convention but not Mr. Nixon. In his honor, couldn't the
GOP at least have arranged for 18-and-a-half minutes of silence?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  One conclusion to be drawn from the Ferraro-Zaccaro tax return is that they're
definitely Democrats.  They pay too much in taxes to be Republicans.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "I'm sure he's a wonderful fellow," Barbara Bush says of Mr. Zaccaro.  That
should end the controversy.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "Fifty million Americans said no to Walter Mondale four years ago," Senator
Baker told the GOP convention.	That's just political hype.  It was only
49,618,685.
  Mr. Mondale describes the GOP platform as "kook right."  If that's true, it'll
never sell to the majority of Americans, who seem closer to kook center.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Some experts say that to win Mr. Mondale needs a huge voter turnout of nearly
100 million people.  Maybe if he wore just one glove and promised to break dance
at the inaugural ball...
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The Mondale campaign says tax changes proposed in the GOP platform would
nearly double the federal deficit.  See?  It's not true that nobody read the
darn thing.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  If he's re-elected and serves a full second term, Mr. Reagan will be almost 78
when he leaves office.	By Kremlin standards that's barely middle age.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  One thing's sure about the upcoming vice presidential candidates' debates:
Unlike Mr. Nixon in 1960, Gerry Ferraro won't lose votes because she has 5
o'clock shadow.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The Populist Party has named Bob Richards, an Olympic pole vaulter in the
1950s, as its presidential candidate.  So don't get too excited if you hear he's
leading in the poles.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  We're looking forward to the presidential candidates' debates.  It'll be
interesting to see which TV shows get higher ratings instead.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  No matter how hard we looked on vacation, we couldn't find any states in which
it's legal to tie kids on the luggage rack and keep suitcases in the back seat.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  We're glad in this Ferraro financial trouble no one redid Mr. Truman's old
line and said, "If you can't stand the heat go back to the kitchen."
	  <<<<***>>>>
  All the U-Haul trucks on the road on our vacation made us glad that when we
fly we don't see many U-Fly planes.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Who said the GOP convention had no surprises?  When Roger Staubach introduced
Nancy Reagan he didn't ask her how she spells relief.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "I'm a conservative," says George Bush, "but I'm not a nut about it."
Unfortunately, that is also the way lots of Americans feel about being voters.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  There's talk of Senator Kassebaum running for vice president in 1988.  That's
awful, but just proves again there's always someone wanting to hurt your career.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Abe Lincoln was the first Republican president.  Of course, back then Mr.
Reagan wasn't yet old enough to run.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  These political conventions haven't been bad as summer television replacement
shows but they'll never make it against a new season of "Hill Street Blues" or
"Cheers."
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The final GOP convention nominating vote was closer than we expected:  2,233
for Ronald Reagan, 0 for Harold Stassen.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  An Illinois and a Pennsylvania delegate refused to vote to nominate the
Reagan-Bush ticket. And party leaders apparently had no abstain remover.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  What is 133 years old and still running hard?  The Reagan-Bush ticket.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  In nominating Mr. Reagan, Senator Laxalt said Grenada now is a "loyal and
trusted ally." And it better stay that way or we'll whip up on it again.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  These political conventions make us realize what a lucky country this is.  For
one thing, we never had to choose between Barry Goldwater and George McGovern in
the same race.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Senator Tower, introducing Mr. Goldwater at the convention, described how "he
galvanized a generation of young people into action."  Right, but most of them
worked against the Goldwater-Miller ticket.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "Every war in this century began and was fought under a Democrat
administration," Mr. Goldwater says.  Luckily, however, a few Republican
soldiers agreed to fight.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Watching`}9Ush sit next to Mr. Reagan at the convention raised the
disturbing question of whether we really want a veep whose leg shows between the
top of his sock and the cuff of his pants.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  GOP delegates booed Tip O'Neill roundly, which, for him, is at least the right
shape.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The Ferraro-Mondale ticket has the Reagan-Bush team beat 5-3, though so far
we're talking only about syllables.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The Missouri delegation's 47 votes put the Reagan-Bush nomination over the top
at the convention.  Well, it was a nasty job but someone had to do it.
  The space shutt{{le Discovery weighs 132 tons.  So, in addition to going round
and round in circles, it has another similarity to the two major political
parties' platforms.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The economy is slowing down, statistics show.  No wonder. It's after Labor Day
and only a few stores are decorated for Christmas.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  A new study says teacher-education programs need to be improved.  For
instance, can't they be trained to attract better quality students?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Hospitals are advertising more.  But we're still waiting for one to offer a
cheap weekend get-away rate.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "We need some morality in our foreign policy," says Rosalynn Carter.  Maybe,
but why be different from every other country?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Our guess on why hospitals are advertising more:  They figure we'll see so
much of it that it'll make us sick.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Judith Resnik, a shuttle crew member, is a classical pianist and enjoys
bicycling.  If Discovery ever has to be pedaled home, the crew is in luck.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The Postal Service wants to raise the cost of a stamp to 23 cents.  Are we
heading for a time when muggers say, "Your life or your stamps"?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Before long we won't need stamps.  We'll be able just to paste a dollar in the
corner of each envelope.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Gerry Ferraro says voters face a "stark choice" in November. Right.  Stay home
and be apathetic or go to the polls and be reluctant.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  John Paul II will visit Canada this month.  Why not have a pro hockey goalie
from there accompany him?  Think what a draw it would be to have the pope and
the goalie host.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The average Chinese dwelling, it's reported, contains just 50 square meters of
floorspace for five or more people.  Sounds like an effective means of birth
control.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Now that Jesse Jackson has endorsed Mr. Mondale, can we expect a press
conference to announce that Gerry Ferraro has decided to do the same?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Overheard on our bus:  "Having a teacher in space isn't such a novel idea.  In
college, for instance, there was my philosophy professor."
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Each new problem that delays space shuttle launches at least helps cut the
number of "citizen passengers" interested in accompanying the crew on future
missions.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Apparently Mr. Reagan figures if he can't get the Lord back in classrooms
he'll at least get a teacher up there closer to Him.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Watching a teacher in space won't be bad.  But we dread the dozens of
inevitable commission reports about it that will follow.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Those who can...do;  those who can't...ride space shuttles.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The nation's prison population has reached a record 454,136, it's reported.
So far we're still among the outmates.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The Iran-Iraq war now has turned in favor of Iraq, analysts say.  See?  We
told you not to invest in Iranian war bonds.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The only good news in the polls so far for the Ferraro-Mondale ticket is it
seems to be runni~ng reasonably well against Undecided.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  On a human body temperature scale, our pennant fever for our team is running
at 98.7.  And holding.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Frankly, we're going to miss Howard Cosell on "Monday Night Football."  But
that's nothing new.  We usually tried to miss him when he was on it, too.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  A sixth s{_traight poor Soviet grain harvest is predicted for this year.  Looks
like they've pretty well figured out how to do that.  Wonder what they'll try
next.
  It's exciting to be in an election year, knowing we're living through the very
history future generations won't remember.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  John Anderson has endorsed Mr. Mondale.  Apparently his new National Unity
Party couldn't find any of its own members willing to lose.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Reagan wants NASA to choose a teacher as the first "citizen passenger" in
space. If it's a one-way trip, our kids have some suggestions.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Explorers in Turkey think they've found Noah's Ark on Mount Ararat.  Know how
they did it?  Just followed their noses.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The Chicago Cubs' magic number now is under 30, which, not coincidentally,
also is pretty close to the current temperature in Hell.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Forget baseball, says the little boy next door.  What's Christmas' magic
number?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The Soviets say they're testing their own new cruise missiles.  There's one
comfort: They're not testing ours.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Jim Brady, White House press secretary, says the only way Mr. Reagan can lose
is if "it comes out that he's a transvestite."  Well, he might get by with that
but not with being a liberal.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Looking back, we'd say our disappointment with the Olympics is that there was
no yodeling competition.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Nixon has decided not to move to New York City. Apparently he, too, feels
he's been punished enough.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Canada just held its elections.  In a bilingual country like that many voters
have to understand both English and French before they may be fully misinformed.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Reagan says there's a "new patriotism" in the country. Yeah, it's hard not
to be proud of a country $1.5 trillion in debt and still on its feet.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The next space shuttle trip will have a crew of seven. Leave it to mankind to
prove it's possible to be crowded even out in space.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  At least that Chicago man who won $40 million in the state lottery has his
prioriti}ies straight:	One of his first purchases was Cubs' tickets.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Investigative reporters have been slipshod about John Zaccaro.  They've probed
his finances but so far haven't turned up his favorite recipe.
	  <<<<***>>>>
 3W How can we vote intelligently this fall when so far we've seen no thorough
explanation of Ferraronomics?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Politicians may be smarter than you think.  Notice that they kiss babies but
don't hang around long enough for the babies to do anything back.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The new prime minister of Canada will be Brian Mulroney. Knowing that may not
make you a better person but what can it hurt?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Congress is back in session. Apparently there are a few knots left to turn

	  <<<<***>>>>
  The British coal strike now is more than six months old.  But so far as we

  Reports from the first days of school indicate some new additions to our kids'
classes: Four boys, three girls, two Jerks, nine nerds and a couple of real

	  <<<<***>>>>
  The number of small farms in the U.S. is rising.  Good. We're trying to eat
smaller portions.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  One of the new fall TV shows features a 300 mph motorcycle. We figure it's
used either by a crime fighter or a presidential candidate, and we're afraid to
ask.
  Syndicated wizards work harder in election years, having to be ready with one
story on why something was inevitable and a second on how any fool should have
seen an upset coming.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  The only thing sure about the baseball season:  It'll end too soon--weeks
before the presidential campaign is over.

  A group thinks Michael Jackson is the Messiah returned.  This time, obviously,
He's upped His ticket prices.

  Israel is having trouble forming a new government.  The trouble here, by
contrast, is reforming the old one.

Detroit a bye to the World Series.

  Most congressional incumbents will win re-election, experts say.  It'll save
having to learn to dislike someone new.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "This president has never seen an arms control agreement he likes," Gerry
Ferraro says.  Is that what Mr. Reagan means by his "safety nyet?"
	  <<<<***>>>>
  We'll believe the Ferraro-Mondale ticket is really confident about winning
the election when we hear it has hired a band for the inaugural ball.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Mondale says any new taxes in his administration will go toward reducing
the budget deficit.  Good idea.  Borrow from Peter to pay Peter.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Mondale and Mr. Reagan have agreed to at least one debate.  So far,
however, there's no word on whether any voters have agreed to listen.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Democrats want to raise national voter turnout from the 85 million of 1980 to
more than 100 million this year.  Isn't it un-American to attack apathy?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  It seemed odd to read that this is only the 50th presidential campaign in U.S.
history.  It seems as if we've lived through 150 since the '40s.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Still, you've got to feel good about a country in which the official starts of
its presidential campaign and its Christmas shopping season coincide.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "Call me an optimist," says Mr. Reagan.  Won't that risk losing him votes in
Rotary and Kiwanis?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Police aren't sure why there's been a big increase in car theft in our city.
Well, for one thing, it's harder to fence a bus.

  The Vietnam Memorial has become the second most popular tourist attraction in
Washington.  Behind what?  The national debt?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Interest on the debt is the fastest-growing federal budget item, it's
reported.  And we've even noticed a growth in interest IN that debt.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  If the military were in as bad shape as some folks say, wouldn't the Army by
now have declared tankruptcy?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Gerry Ferraro is attacking Mr. Reagan on the war-and-peace issue.  Isn't it
risky to argue with a guy who can order your campaign headquarters bazookaed?
	  <<<<***>>>>
  "Penthouse" plans to publish a new set of nude pictures of Vanessa Williams in
January. Sounds like a double exposure.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Rumors say Konstantin Chernenko is ill.  For his sake, let's hope it's nothing
fatal like a common cold.
	  <<<<***>>>>
  It was obvious that Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush used the same writer for their
acceptance speeches.  The first 150 or so words of each talk were the same:
"Thank you, thank you very much, thank you, thank you..."
	  <<<<***>>>>
  Mr. Reagan listed few goals for the future in his GOP convention speech.
Maybe the good news is he doesn't have many.

MICROSOFT SHOULD MAKE CARS, GENERAL MOTORS SHOULD MAKE SOFTWARE.

At a recent computer expo, Bill Gates reportedly compared the
computer industry with the auto industry and stated:

"If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we
would all be driving twenty-five dollar cars that got 1000 miles to
the gallon."

In response to Bill's comments General Motors issued a press release
stating the following: "If GM had developed technology like
Microsoft, we would be driving cars with the following
characteristics:

1.  For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.

2.  Every time they repainted the lines on the road, you would have
    to buy a new car.

3.  Occasionally, your car would die on the freeway for no reason,
    and you would accept this, restart, and drive on.

4.  Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would
    cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart; in which case
    you would have to reinstall the engine.

5.  Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought
    'Car95' or 'CarNT'. Then you would have to buy more seats.

6.  Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was more
    reliable, five times as fast, and twice as easy to drive, but
    would only run on five percent of the roads.

7.  The oil, water, temperature and alternator warning lights would
    be replaced by a single 'general car fault' warning light.

8.  New seats would force everyone to have the same butt size.

9.  The airbag system would say 'Are you sure?'  before going off.

10. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you
    out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the
    door handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio
    antenna.

11. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of
    Rand McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they
    neither need them nor want them. Attempting to delete this option
    would immediately cause the car's performance to diminish by 50

The Customer Is Always Right
----------------------------

A crusty old man walks into a bank and says to the
woman at the teller window "I want to open a damn
checking account". The astonished woman replies, "I
beg your pardon, sir. I must have misunderstood you.
What did you say?"

"Listen up, damnit. I said I want to open a damn
checking account now!"

"I'm very sorry sir, but that kind of language is not
tolerated in this bank." The teller leaves the window
and goes over to the bank manager to inform him of her
situation. The manager agrees that the teller does not
have to listen to that foul language. They both return
to the window and the manager asks the old geezer,

"Sir, what seems to be the problem here?"

"There is no damn problem", the man says. "I just won
50 million bucks in the damn lottery and I want to
open a damn checking account in this damn bank, okay?"

"I see", says the manager, "and is this bitch giving 
you a hard time?

The age gap and Dad's knowledge

At  4: Dad knows everything.
At  7: Dad knows a lot.
At  8: Dad does not know everything.
At 12: Well, Dad won't know anyway.
At 14: Dad is hopelessly old-fashioned.
At 21: Oh heck, the man's time has long passed, how would he know!
At 25: Dad knows something, but not very much.
At 30: I'll just hear what Dad has to say anyway.
At 35: Let's wait a while and hear what Dad's opinion is.
At 50: I wonder what dad would have said.
At 60: Dad, in actual fact, knew everything.
At 65: I wish I could have discussed it with Dad.

The Dark Sucker Theory

For years, it has been believed that electric light bulbs emit light,
but recent information has proven otherwise. Electric bulbs DO NOT
emit light. They suck dark. Thus we call these bulbs Dark Suckers.
The Dark Sucker theory and the existence of the Dark Suckers prove
that dark has mass and is heavier than light.

First, the basis of the Dark Sucker theory is that electric light
bulbs suck dark. For example, take the Dark Sucker in the room that
you are in. There is much less dark right next to it than there is
elsewhere. The larger the Dark Sucker, the greater its capacity to
suck dark. Dark Suckers in the  parking lot have a much greater
capacity to suck dark than the ones in your room. As with all things,
Dark Suckers don't last forever. Once they are full of dark, they can
no longer suck. This is proved by the black spot on a full Dark
Sucker. A candle is a primitive Dark Sucker. A new candle has a white
wick. After the first use, you can see that the wick turns black,
showing all the dark that has been sucked into it. If you place an
object next to the wick of an operating candle, it will turn black.
This is because it got in the way of the dark flowing into the
candle. One of the disadvantages of the these primitive Dark Suckers
is their limited range. There are also portable Dark Suckers. In
these, the bulbs cannot handle all of the dark by themselves and must
be aided by Dark Storage Units. When a Dark Storage Unit is full of
dark, it must be either emptied or replaced before the portable Dark
Sucker can operate again.

Dark has mass. When it goes into a Dark Sucker, friction from the
moving mass generates heat. Thus it is not wise to touch an operating
Dark Sucker.

Candles present a special problem, as the mass must travel into a thin
solid wick instead of through clear glass. This generates a great amount
of heat and is therefore even less smart to touch an operating candle.
Also, dark is heavier than light. If you were to slowly swim just below
the surface of a lake, you would see a lot of light. As you swim deeper
and deeper, it gets darker and darker. When you get real deep, you will
be in total darkness. This is because the heavier dark sinks to the
bottom of the lake and the lighter light floats to the top. This is why
it is called light.

Finally, we must prove that dark is faster than light. If you were to
stand  in a well lit room in front of a closed closet full of dark and
slowly open the door, you will see the light slowly enter the closet.
But since dark is  so fast, you will not be able to see the dark leave
the closet.

So next time you see an electric bulb, remember, it is a DARK SUCKER!!

International 1999 Darwin Awards

One of the long awaited moments of each New Year is the awarding of
the Darwin Award.  This prestigious award recognises those people, who
through stupid and inane actions kill themselves, thus improving society
by removing their genes from the genepool.  So here are the runners-up
for this year's award.

(15 July 1999, Alabama) A 25-year-old soldier died of injuries
sustained from a 3-story fall, precipitated by his attempt to spit
farther than his buddy.  His plan was to hurl himself towards a metal
guard-rail while expectorating, in order to add momentum to his saliva.
In a tragic miscalculation, his momentum carried him right over the
railing, which he caught hold of for a few moments before his grip
slipped, sending him plummeting 24 feet to the cement below. The
military specialist had a blood alcohol content of 0.14%, impairing his
judgement and paving the way for his opportunity to win a Darwin Award.

(11 August 1999) A 42-year-old man killed himself watching the eclipse
while driving near Kaiserslautern, Germany. A witness driving behind him
stated that the man was weaving back and forth as he concentrated on the
partially occluded sun, when he suddenly accelerated and hit the bridge
pier.  He had apparently just donned his solar viewers, which are dark
enough to totally obscure everything except the sun.

(25 May 1999, Ukraine) A fisherman in Kiev electrocuted himself while
fishing in the river Tereblya. The 43-year-old man connected cables to
the main power supply of his home, and trailed the end into the river.
The electric shock killed the fish, which floated belly-up to the top of
the water. The man waded in to collect his catch, neglecting to remove
the live wire, and tragically suffered the same fate as the fish. In an
ironic twist, the man was fishing for a mourning meal to commemorate the
first anniversary of his mother-in-law's death.

(16 August 1999, Germany) A hunter from Bad Urach was shot dead by his
own dog on Monday.  The 51-year-old man was found sprawled next to his
car in the Black Forest.  A gun barrel was pointing out the window, and
his bereaved dog was howling inside the car. The animal is presumed to
have pressed the trigger with its paw. Police have ruled out foul play.

(1991, Nicosia, Cypress) Under similar circumstances, an Iranian hunter
was shot to death near Tehran by a snake that coiled around his shotgun
as he pinned the reptile to the ground. Another hunter reported that
the victim, named Ali, tried to catch the snake alive by pressing the
butt of his shotgun behind its head. The snake coiled around the butt
and pulled the trigger, shooting Ali in the head.

(August 1999, Australia) Drinking oneself to death need not be a long,
lingering process.  Allan, a 33-year-old computer technician, showed
his competitive spirit by dying of competitive spirits. A Sydney,
Australia hotel bar held a drinking competition, known as Feral Friday,
with a 100-minute time limit and a sliding point scale ranging from 1
point for beer to 8 points for hard liquor. Allan stood and cheered his
winning total of 236; (winners never quit!) which had also netted him
the literally staggering blood alcohol level of 0.353, 7 times greater
than Australia's legal driving limit of 0.05%. After several trips to
the usual temple of over-indulgence, the bathroom, Allan was helped
back to his work place to sleep it off, a condition that became
permanent.  A forensic pharmacologist estimated that after downing 34
beers, 4 bourbons, and 17 shots of tequila within 1 hour and 40
minutes, his blood alcohol level would have been 0.41 to 0.43, but
Allan had vomited several times after the drinking stopped.  The cost
paid by Allan was much higher than that of the hotel, which was fined
the equivalent of $13,100 US dollars for not intervening. It is not
known whether Allan required any further embalming.

(28 January 1999, London) A flock of sheep charged a well-meaning
British farmer's wife and pushed her over a cliff to her death. Betty
Stobbs, 67,was charged by dozens of sheep as she brought them a bale of
hay on the back of a power bike.  The sheep rushed forward and rammed
the vehicle, knocking Betty and her bike over the edge of a vacant 100'
quarry near Durham, in northern England. "I saw the sheep surround the
bike. The next thing she was tumbling down the incline", neighbour Alan
Renfry told reporters.

First Runner Up Award goes to ....

(22 March 1999, Phnom Penh) Decades of armed strife has littered
Cambodia with unexploded munitions and ordnance.  Authorities warn
citizens not to tamper with the devices. Three friends recently spent
an evening sharing drinks and exchanging insults at a local cafe in the
south-eastern province of Svay Rieng.  Their companionable arguing
continued for hours, until one man pulled out a 25-year-old unexploded
anti-tank mine found in his backyard. He tossed it under the table, and
the three men began playing Russian roulette, each tossing down a drink
and then stamping on the mine.  The other villagers fled in terror. 
Minutes later, the explosive detonated with a tremendous boom, killing
the three men in the bar. "Their wives could not even find their flesh
because the blast destroyed everything", the Rasmei Kampuchea newspaper
reported.

And the 1999 Darwin Award winner is....

(5 September 1999, Jerusalem) The switch away from daylight savings
time caused consternation among terrorist groups this year. At
precisely 5:30 Israel time on Sunday, two co-ordinated car bombs
exploded in different cities, killing the three terrorists who were
transporting the bombs. It was initially believed that the devices had
been detonated prematurely by klutzy amateurs. A closer look revealed
the truth behind the untimely explosions. Three days before, Israel had
made a premature switch from daylight savings time to standard time in
order to accommodate a week of Slihot, involving pre-sunrise prayers.
Palestinians refused to "live on Zionist time".  Two weeks of
scheduling havoc ensued.  The bombs had been prepared in a
Palestine-controlled area, and set on Daylight Savings time. The
confused drivers had already switched to standard time. As a result,
the cars were still en-route when the explosives detonated, delivering
to the terrorists their well-deserved demise.

And God created woman and she had 3 breasts. He then asked the
woman, "Is there anything you'd like to have changed?"

She replied, "Yes, could you get rid of this middle breast?"

And so it was done, and it was good.

Then the woman exclaimed as she was holding that third breast in
her hand, "What can be done with this useless boob?"

And God created man.

===================================
        If you ever drop your keys into a river of molten lava, let'em
go, because, man, they're gone.

        If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them
own? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason."

        To me, it's a good idea to always carry two sacks of something
when you walk around. That way, if anybody says, "Hey, can you give me a
hand?" You can say, "Sorry, got these sacks."

        One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going
to take my nephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him to an old
burned-out warehouse. "Oh no," I said, "Disneyland burned down." He cried
and cried, but I think that deep down he thought it was a pretty good
joke. I started to drive over to the real Disneyland, but it was getting
pretty late.

        The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of
the face.

        If you lived in the Dark Ages and you were a catapult operator, I
bet the most common question people would ask is, "Can't you make it
shoot farther?" "No, I'm sorry. That's as far as it shoots."

        Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful, beautiful
flamingo, flying across in front of a beautiful sunset? And he's carrying
a beautiful rose in his beak, and also he's carrying a very beautiful
painting with his feet. And also, you're drunk.

        I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not our
children's children, because I don't think children should be having sex.

        If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell
him is, "God is crying." And if he asks why God is crying, another cute
thing to tell him is, "Probably because of something you did."

        If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the
mirror, because I bet that's what REALLY throws you into a panic.

        Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my
first instinct is to laugh. But then I think, what if I was an ant and
she fell on me. Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny.

        To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no
choreography and the dancers hit each other.

        I hope if dogs ever take over the world and they choose a king,
they don't just go by size, because I bet there are some Chihuahuas with
some good ideas.

        If life deals you lemons, why not go kill someone with the lemons
(maybe by shoving them down his throat).

        Instead of having "answers" on a math test, they should just call
them "impressions," and if you got a different "impression," so what,
can't we all be brothers?
>From the Saturday Night Live genius
===================================
        Probably the earliest fly swatters were nothing more than some
sort of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.

        I wish I would have a real tragic love affair and get so bummed
out that I'd just quit my job and become a bum for a few years, because I
was thinking about doing that anyway.

        I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate
revolver. And since he's so busy, you'd probably have to run up to him
real quick and hand it to him.

        Maybe in order to understand mankind we have to look at that word
itself. MANKIND. Basically, it's made up of two separate words "mank" and
"ind." What do these words mean? It's a mystery and that's why so is mankind.

        If you go flying back through time and you see somebody else
flying forward into the future, it's probably best to avoid eye contact.

        It's easy to sit there and say you'd like to have more money. And
I guess that's what I like about it. It's easy. Just sitting there,
rocking back and forth, wanting that money.

        If you ever reach total enlightenment while you're drinking a
beer, I bet it makes beer shoot out your nose.

        To me, clowns aren't funny. In fact, they're kinda scary. I've
wondered where this started and I think it goes back to the time I went
to the circus and a clown killed my dad.

        As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to red
again, I sat there thinking about life. Was it nothing more than a bunch
of honking and yelling? Sometimes it seemed that way.

        I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without
hate. And I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd never
expect it.

        I hope some animal never bores a hole in my head and lays its
eggs in my brain, because later you might think you're having a good idea
but it's just eggs hatching.

        Whenever you read a good book, it's like the author is right
there, in the room talking to you, which is why I don't like to read good
books.

        What is it about a beautiful sunny afternoon, with the birds
singing and the wind rustling through the leaves, that makes you want to
get drunk? And after you're real drunk, maybe go down to the public park
and stagger around and ask people for money, and then lay down and go to
sleep.

        Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window? The guy looks
out it, and if he leans too far, he falls out. Wait. I guess that's like
a regular window.

        During the Middle Ages, probably one of the biggest mistakes was
not putting on your armor because you were "just going down to the corner."

        If I ever get real rich, I hope I'm not real mean to poor people,
like I am now.

        When I found the skull in the woods, the first thing I did was
call the police. But then I got curious about it. I picked it up, and
started wondering who this person was, and why he had deer horns.

        I remember how my great-uncle Jerry would sit on the porch and
whittle all day long. Once he whittled me a toy boat out of a larger toy
boat I had. It was almost as good as the first one, except now it had
bumpy whittle marks all over it. And no paint, because he had whittled
off the paint.

        Here's a good thing to do if you go to a party and you don't know
anybody: First take out the garbage. Then go around and collect any extra
garbage that people might have, like a crumpled napkin, and take that out
too. Pretty soon people will want to meet the busy garbage guy.

                  * MORE DEEP THOUGHTS * 

                      BY JACK HANDY

If they ever come up with a swashbuckling School, I think one of
the courses should be Laughing, Then Jumping Off Something.

When you're riding in a time machine way far into the future,
don't stick your elbow out the window, or it'll turn into a
fossil.

It takes a big man to cry, but it takes a bigger man to laugh at
that man.

At first I thought, if I were Superman, a perfect secret identity
would be "Clark Kent, Dentist," because you could save money on
tooth X-rays. But then I thought, if a patient said, "How's my
back tooth?" and you just looked at it with your X-ray vision and
said, "Oh it's okay," then the patient would probably say,
"Aren't you going to take an X-ray, stupid?" and you'd say, "Aw
fuck you, get outta here," and then he probably wouldn't even pay
his bill.

One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going
to take my little nephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him
to an old burned-out warehouse. "Oh, no," I said. "Disneyland
burned down." He cried and cried, but I think that deep down, he
thought it was a pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the
real Disneyland, but it was getting pretty late.

A good way to threaten somebody is to light a stick of dynamite.
Then you call the guy and hold the burning fuse up to the phone.
"Hear that?" you say. "That's dynamite, baby."

Why do people in ship mutinies always ask for "better
treatment"? I'd ask for a pinball machine, because with all that
rocking back and forth you'd probably be able to get a lot of
free games.

I'd like to be buried Indian-style, where they put you up on a
high rack, above the ground. That way, you could get hit by
meteorites and not even feel it.

If I lived back in the wild west days, instead of carrying a
six-gun in my holster, I'd carry a soldering iron. That way, if
some smart-aleck cowboy said something like "Hey, look. He's
carrying a soldering iron!" and started laughing, and everybody
else started laughing, I could just say, "That's right, it's a
soldering iron. The soldering iron of justice." Then everybody
would get real quiet and ashamed, because they had made fun of
the soldering iron of justice, and I could probably hit them up
for a free drink.

I bet when the neanderthal kids would make a snowman, someone
would always end up saying, "Don't forget the thick, heavy
brows." Then they would all get embarrassed because they
remembered they had the big hunky brows too, and they'd get mad
and eat the snowman.

Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion. For instance, let's say
you're an astronaught on the moon and you fear that your partner
has been turned into Dracula. The next time he goes out for the
moon pieces, wham!, you just slam the door behind him and blast
off. He might call you on the radio and say he's not Dracula, but
you just say, "Think again, bat man."

Too bad you can't buy a voodoo globe so that you could make the
earth spin real fast and freak everybody out.

The people in the village were real poor, so none of the
children had any toys. But this one little boy had gotten an old
enema bag and filled it with rocks, and he would go around and
whap the other children across the face with it. Man, I think my
heart almost broke. Later the boy came up and offered to give me
the toy. This was too much! I reached out my hand, but then he
ran away. I chased him down and took the enema bag. He cried a
little, but that's the way of these people.

I wish I had a Kryptonite cross, because then you could keep both
Dracula AND Superman away.

I don't think I'm alone when I say I'd like to see more and more
planets fall under the ruthless domination of our solar system.

Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine, which I guess
is why several of us died of tuberculosis.

Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word
itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words
- "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and
that's why so is mankind.

I hope if dogs ever take over the world, and they chose a king,
they don't just go by size, because I bet there are some
Chihuahuas with some good ideas.

I guess we were all guilty, in a way. We all shot him, we all
skinned him, and we all got a complimentary bumper sticker that
said, "I helped skin Bob."

I bet the main reason the police keep people away from a plane
crash is they don't want anybody walking in and lying down in the
crash stuff, then, when somebody comes up, act like they just
woke up and go, "What was THAT?!"

The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of
the face.

Ambition is like a frog sitting on a Venus Flytrap. The flytrap
can bite and bite, but it won't bother the frog because it only
has little tiny plant teeth. But some other stuff could happen
and it could be like ambition.

I'd rather be rich than stupid.

If you were a poor Indian with no weapons, and a bunch of
conquistadors came up to you and asked where the gold was, I
don't think it would be a good idea to say, "I swallowed it. So
sue me."

If you define cowardice as running away at the first sign of
danger, screaming and tripping and begging for mercy, then yes,
Mr. Brave man, I guess I'm a coward.

I bet one legend that keeps recurring throughout history, in
every culture, is the story of Popeye.

When you go in for a job interview, I think a good thing to ask
is if they ever press charges.

To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no
choreography, and the dancers hit each other.

What is it that makes a complete stranger dive into an icy river
to save a solid gold baby? Maybe we'll never know.

We tend to scoff at the beliefs of the ancients. But we can't
scoff at them personally, to their faces, and this is what annoys
me.

Probably the earliest flyswatters were nothing more than some
sort of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.

I think someone should have had the decency to tell me the
luncheon was free. To make someone run out with potato salad in
his hand, pretending he's throwing up, is not what I call
hospitality.

To me, clowns aren't funny. In fact, they're kind of scary. I've
wondered where this started and I think it goes back to the time
I went to the circus, and a clown killed my dad.

As I bit into the nectarine, it had a crisp juiciness about it
that was very pleasurable - until I realized it wasn't a
nectarine at all, but A HUMAN HEAD!!

Most people don't realize that large pieces of coral, which have
been painted brown and attached to the skull by common wood
screws, can make a child look like a deer.

If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them
down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good
reason.

Better not take a dog on the space shuttle, because if he sticks
his head out when you're coming home his face might burn up.

You know what would make a good story? Something about a clown
who make people happy, but inside he's real sad. Also, he has
severe diarrhea.

Sometimes when I feel like killing someone, I do a little trick
to calm myself down. I'll go over to the persons house and ring
the doorbell. When the person comes to the door, I'm gone, but
you know what I've left on the porch? A jack-o-lantern with a
knife stuck in the side of it's head with a note that says "You."
After that I usually feel a lot better, and no harm done.

If you're a horse, and someone gets on you, and falls off, and
then gets right back on you, I think you should buck him off
right away.

If you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing
is to keep the students from just trying to yodel right off. You
see, we build to that.

If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because
maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you
because, hey, free dummy.

I'd like to see a nude opera, because when they hit those high
notes, I bet you can really see it in those genitals.

Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto
someones neck, and the guy screams and tries to get it off, I
have to laugh, because what is that thing.

He was a cowboy, mister, and he loved the land. He loved it so
much he made a woman out of dirt and married her. But when he
kissed her, she disintegrated. Later, at the funeral, when the
preacher said, "Dust to dust," some people laughed, and the
cowboy shot them. At his hanging, he told the others, "I'll be
waiting for you in heaven--with a gun."

The memories of my family outings are still a source of strength
to me. I remember we'd all pile into the car - I forget what kind
it was - and drive and drive. I'm not sure where we'd go, but I
think there were some trees there. The smell of something was
strong in the air as we played whatever sport we played. I
remember a bigger, older guy we called "Dad." We'd eat some
stuff, or not, and then I think we went home. I guess some things
never leave you.

If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to
tell him is "God is crying." And if he asks why God is crying,
another cute thing to tell him is "Probably because of something
you did."

Contrary to what most people say, the most dangerous animal in
the world is not the lion or the tiger or even the elephant. It's
a shark riding on an elephant's back, just trampling and eating
everything they see.

As we were driving, we saw a sign that said "Watch for Rocks."
Marta said it should read "Watch for Pretty Rocks." I told her
she should write in her suggestion to the highway department, but
she started saying it was a joke - just to get out of writing a
simple letter! And I thought I was lazy!

One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going
to take my little nephew to DisneyLand, but instead I drove him
to an old burned-out warehouse. "Oh, no," I said, "DisneyLand
burned down." He cried and cried, but I think that deep down he
thought it was a pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the
real DisneyLand, but it was getting pretty late.

If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you
think liked dolphins the most? I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you?
You'd be wrong, though. It's Hambone.

Laurie got offended that I used the word "puke." But to me,
that's what her dinner tasted like.

We used to laugh at Grandpa when he'd head off and go fishing.
But we wouldn't be laughing that evening when he'd come back with
some whore he picked up in town.

I wish a robot would get elected president. That way, when he
came to town, we could all take a shot at him and not feel too
bad.

As the evening sky faded from a salmon color to a sort of flint
gray, I thought back to the salmon I caught that morning, and how
gray he was, and how I named him Flint.

If you're a young Mafia gangster out on your first date, I bet
it's real embarrassing if someone tries to kill you.

Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my
first instinct is to laugh. But then I think, what is I was an
ant, and she fell on me. Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny.

If you go parachuting, and your parachute doesn't open, and you
friends are all watching you fall, I think a funny gag would be
to pretend you were swimming.

When I was a kid my favorite relative was Uncle Caveman. After
school we'd all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he
would eat one of us. It wasn't until later that I found out that
Uncle Caveman was a bear.

Children need encouragement. If a kid gets an answer right, tell
him it was a lucky guess. That way he develops a good, lucky
feeling.

The crows seemed to be calling his name, thought Caw.

When you die, if you get a choice between going to regular
heaven or pie heaven, choose pie heaven. It might be a trick, but
if it's not, mmmmmmm, boy.

Whether they find a life there or not, I think Jupiter should be
called an enemy planet.

Instead of trying to build newer and bigger weapons of
destruction, we should be thinking about getting more use out of
the ones we already have.

I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate
revolver. and since he is so busy, you'd probably have to run up
to him real quick and give it to him.

Just because swans mate for life, I don't think its that big a
deal. First of all, if you're a swan, you're probably not going
to find a swan that looks much better than the one you've got, so
why not mate for life?

If you're robbing a bank and you're pants fall down, I think
it's okay to laugh and to let the hostages laugh too, because,
come on, life is funny.

If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid looking in a mirror,
because I bet that will really throw you into a panic.

Sometimes I think I'd be better off dead. No, wait, not me, you.

I can't stand cheap people. It makes me real mad when someone
says something like, "Hey, when are you going to pay me that $100
you owe me?" or "Do you have that $50 you borrowed?" Man, quit
being so cheap!

I think the mistake a lot of us make is thinking the
state-appointed shrink is our friend.

I think one way the cops could make money would be to hold a
murder weapons sale. Many people could really use used ice picks.

If you ever reach total enlightenment while drinking beer, I bet
you could shoot beer out of you nose.

I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not our
children's children, because I don't think children should be
having sex.

Even though I was their captive, the Indians allowed me quite a
bit of freedom. I could walk freely, make my own meals, and even
hurl large rocks at their heads. It was only later that I
discovered that they were not Indians at all but only
dirty-clothes hampers.

I wish outer space guys would conquer the Earth and make people
their pets, because I'd like to have one of those little beds
with my name on it.

It's true that every time you hear a bell, an angel gets its
wings. But what they don't tell you is that every time you hear a
mouse trap snap, and Angel gets set on fire.

If you're in a war, instead of throwing a hand grenade at the
enemy, throw one of those small pumpkins. Maybe it'll make
everyone think how stupid war is, and while they are thinking,
you can throw a real grenade at them.

I hope life isn't a big joke, because I don't get it.

The next time I have meat and mashed potatoes, I think I'll put
a very large blob of potatoes on my plate with just a little
piece of meat. And if someone asks me why I didn't get more meat,
I'll just say, "Oh, you mean this?" and pull out a big piece of
meat from inside the blob of potatoes, where I've hidden it. Good
magic trick, huh?

Life, to me, is like a quiet forest pool, one that needs a
direct hit from a big rock half-buried in the ground. You pull
and you pull, but you can't get the rock out of the ground. So
you give it a good kick, but you lose your balance and go
skidding down the hill toward the pool. Then out comes a big
Hawaiian man who was screwing his wife beside the pool because
they thought it was real pretty. He tells you to get out of
there, but you start faking it, like you're talking Hawaiian, and
then he gets mad and chases you...

Sometimes, when I drive across the desert in the middle of the
night, with no other cars around, I start imagining: What if
there were no civilization out there? No cities, no factories, no
people? And then I think: No people or factories? Then who made
this car? And this highway? And I get so confused I have to stick
my head out the window into the driving rain---unless there's
lightning, because I could get struck on the head by a bolt.

The whole town laughed at my great-grandfather, just because he
worked hard and saved his money. True, working at the hardware
store didn't pay much, but he felt it was better than what
everybody else did, which was go up to the volcano and collect
the gold nuggets it shot out every day. It turned out he was
right. After forty years, the volcano petered out. Everybody left
town, and the hardware store went broke. Finally he decided to
collect gold nuggets too, but there weren't many left by then.
Plus, he broke his leg and the doctor's bills were real high.

Too bad when I was a kid there wasn't a guy in our class that
everybody called the "Cricket Boy", because I would have liked to
stand up in class and tell everybody, "You can make fun of the
Cricket Boy if you want to, but to me he's just like everybody
else." Then everybody would leave the Cricket Boy alone, and I'd
invite him over to spend the night at my house, but after about
five minutes of that loud chirping I'd have to kick him out.
Maybe later we could get up a petition to get the Cricket Family
run out of town. Bye, Cricket Boy.

I think a good product would be "Baby Duck Hat". It's a fake baby
duck, which you strap on top of your head. Then you go swimming
underwater until you find a mommy duck and her babies, and you
join them. Then, all of a sudden, you stand up out of the water
and roar like Godzilla. Man, those ducks really take off! Also,
Baby Duck Hat is good for parties.

I wish I lived back in the old west days, because I'd save up my
money for about twenty years so I could buy a solid-gold pick.
Then I'd go out West and start digging for gold. When someone
came up and asked what I was doing, I'd say, "Looking for gold,
ya durn fool." He'd say, "Your pick is gold," and I'd say, "Well,
that was easy." Good joke, huh.

A funny thing to do is, if you're out hiking and your friend gets
bitten by a poisonous snake, tell him you're going to go for
help, then go about ten feet and pretend that *you* got bit by a
snake. Then start an argument with him about who's going to go
get help. A lot of guys will start crying. That's why it makes
you feel good when you tell them it was just a joke.

I guess I kinda lost control, because in the middle of the play
I ran up and lit the evil puppet villain on fire. No, I didn't.
Just kidding. I just said that to help illustrate one of the human
emotions, which is freaking out. Another emotion is greed, as
when you kill someone for money, or something like that. Another
emotion is generosity, as when you pay someone double what he
paid for his stupid puppet.

Many people think that history is a dull subject. Dull? Is it
"dull" that Jesse James once got bitten on the forehead by an
ant, and at first it didn't seem like anything, but then the bite
got worse and worse, so he went to a doctor in town, and the
secretary told him to wait, so he sat down and waited, and
waited, and waited, and waited, and then finally he got to see
the doctor, and the doctor put some salve on it? You call that
dull?

I scrambled to the top of the precipice where Nick was waiting.
"That was fun," I said. "You bet it was," said Nick. "Let's climb
higher." "No," I said. "I think we should be heading back now."
"We have time," Nick insisted. I said we didn't, and Nick said we
did. We argued back and forth like that for about 20 minutes,
then finally decided to head back. I didn't say it was an
interesting story.

If you're a Thanksgiving dinner, but you don't like the stuffing
or the cranberry sauce or anything else, just pretend like you're
eating it, but instead, put it all in your lap and form it into a
big mushy ball. Then, later, when you're out back having cigars
with the boys, let out a big fake cough and throw the ball to the
ground. Then say, "Boy, these are good cigars!"

I remember that one fateful day when Coach took me aside. I knew
what was coming. "You don't have to tell me," I said. "I'm off
the team, aren't I?" "Well," said Coach, "you never were really
ON the team. You made that uniform you're wearing out of rags and
towels, and your helmet is a toy space helmet. You show up at
practice and then either steal the ball and make us chase you to
get it back, or you try to tackle people at inappropriate times."
It was all true what he was saying. And yet, I thought something
is brewing inside the head of this Coach. He sees something in
me, some kind of raw talent that he can mold. But that's when I
felt the handcuffs go on.

If I ever opened a trampoline store, I don't think I'd call it
Trampo-Land, because you might think it was a store for tramps,
which is not the inpression we are trying to convey with our
store. On the other hand, we would not prohibit tramps from
browsing, or testing the trampolines, unless a tramp's gyrations
seemed to be getting out of control.

I can still recall old Mister Barnslow getting out every morning
and nailing a fresh load of tadpoles to the old board of his.
Then he'd spin it round and round, like a wheel of fortune, and
no matter where it stopped he'd yell out, "Tadpoles! Tadpoles is
a winner!" We all thought he was crazy. But then we had some
growing up to do.

Once when I was in Hawaii, on the island of Kauai, I met a
mysterious old stranger. He said he was about to die and wanted
to tell someone about the treasure. I said, "Okay, as long as
it's not a long story. Some of us have a plane to catch, you
know." He stared telling hes story, about the treasure and his
life and all, and I thought: "This story isn't too long." But
then, he kept going, and I started thinking, "Uh-oh, this story
is getting long." But then the story was over, and I said to
myself: "You know, that story wasn't too long after all." I
forget what the story was about, but there was a good movie on
the plane. It was a little long, though.

I bet a fun thing would be to go way back in time to where there
was going to be an eclipse and tell the cave men, "If I have come
to destroy you, may the sun be blotted out from the sky." Just
then the eclipse would start, and they'd probably try to kill you
or something, but then you could explain about the rotation of
the moon and all, and everyone would get a good laugh.

I wouldn't be surprised if someday some fishermen caught a big
shark and cut it open, and there inside was a whole person. Then
they cut the person open, and in him is a little baby shark. And
in the baby shark there isn't a person, because it would be too
small. But there's a little doll or something, like a Johnny
Combat little toy guy---something like that.

What If Dr. Seuss Did Technical Writing?

Here's an easy game to play.
Here's an easy thing to say:

If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,
And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort,
And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort,
Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!

If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash,
And the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash,
And your data is corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash,
Then your situation's hopeless, and your system's gonna crash!

You can't say this?
What a shame sir!
We'll find you
Another game sir.

If the label on the cable on the table at your house,
Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse,
But your packets want to tunnel on another protocol,
That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall,

And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss
So your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse,
Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang,
'Cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang!

When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk,
And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary risc,
Then you have to flash your memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM.
Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your mom!

            neither embarrassed nor frustrated.

ObHumor:

"Come to think of it, there are already a million monkeys on a million
typewriters, and Usenet is NOTHING like Shakespeare."
         -- Blair Houghton

The actual origins of the Annual Adolph Eichmann's Evil Cake Contest
are probably better off lost in the hall-closet of history, but the
legend remains.

The contest was born out of a student paper on Hannah Arendt which was
submitted as an assignment in The Schoolhouse (a writing program).
The only extant fragment of that immortal paper is part of its final
sentence: "...but the icing on Adolph Eichmann's evil cake was..."
which spawned a tradition of writing unknown to man before its time,
and which has been reverently memorialized by an annual event.

Excerpts from this year's contest entries rate no more introduction:

"In short, Socrates seems to be the philosophical napkin with which
the ensuing cultural thinkers of history wipe their mouths of pedantic
ooze."

"The Syracusans defeated the Athenians on their own turf, the sea."

"Like raisins in a bread pudding, the moments lie within the body
of Henry."

"As a domestic animal, Othello is a child."

"Morality is ubiquitous in everything that is good or bad."

Long ago, in the days when all disks flopped in the breeze and the
writing of words was on a star, the Blue Giant dug for the people
the Pea Sea. But he needed a creature who could sail the waters, and
would need for support but few rams.

So the Gateskeeper, who was said to be both micro and soft,
fashioned a Dosfish, which was small and spry, and could swim the
narrow sixteen-bit channel. But the Dosfish was not bright, and
could be taught few new tricks. His alphabet had no As, Bs, or Qs,
and only a mere 640 Ks, and the size of his file cabinet was limited
by his own fat.

At first the people loved the Dosfish, as he was the only one who
could swim the Pea Sea. But the people soon grew tired of commanding
his line, and complained that he could be neither dragged nor
dropped. "Gadzooks!" cried they. "The Dosfish can do only one job at
a time, and of names, he knows but eight and three!" And many of
them left the Pea Sea for good, going off to search for the Magic
Apple.

Although many went, far more stayed because admittance to the Pea
Sea was cheap. So the Gateskeeper studied the Magic Apple, and
rested awhile in the Parc of Xer-Ox, whereupon he fashioned a Window
that could ride on the Dosfish and do the thinking for it. But the
Window was slow, and it would break when the Dosfish got confused.
So most people resigned themselves to the Dosfish.

Now it came to pass that the Blue Giant visited the Gateskeeper,
and spake thus: "Come, let us make of ourselves something greater
than the Dosfish." The Blue Giant seemed like a humbug, so they
called the new creature Oz II.

Now Oz II was smarter than the Dosfish (as most things are). It
could drag and drop and keep files without becoming fat. But the
people cared for it not. So the Blue Giant and the Gateskeeper
promised another Oz II, to be called Oz II Too, that could swim the
fast, new, 32-bit wide Pea Sea.

But lo! A strange miracle occurred. Although the Window that rode
on the Dosfish was slow, it was pretty, and the third Window was the
prettiest. And the people began to like this third Window, and to
use it. So the Gateskeeper turned to the Blue Giant and said, "Fie
on thee, for I need thee not. Keep thy OZ II Too, and I shall make
of my Window an Entity that will not need the Dosfish, and will swim
in the 32-bit Pea Sea."

Years passed, and the workshops of the Gateskeeper and the Blue
Giant were overrun by many insects. And the people went on using
their Dosfish with a Window. And, even though the Dosfish would,
from time to time, become confused and die, it could always be
revived with three fingers.

Then came the day when the Blue Giant unleashed his OZ II Too onto
the world. The Oz II Too was indeed mighty, and awesome, and
required a great ram, but the world was changed not a whit. For the
people said, "It is indeed great, but we see little application for
it." And they were doubtful, because the Blue
Giant had met with the Magic Apple, and together they were
fashioning a Taligent, and the Taligent was made of objects, and was
most pink.

Now the Gateskeeper had grown ambitious, and as he had been
ambitious before he grew, he was now more ambitious still. So he
protected his Window Entity with great security, and made its net
work both in serving and with peers. And the Entity would swim, not
only in the Pea Sea, but in the Oceans of Great Risk. "Yea,"
declared the Gateskeeper, "though my entity will require a greater
ram than Oz II Too, it will be more powerful than a world of
Eunuchs!"

And so the Gateskeeper prepared to unleash his Entity to the world,
in all but two cities. For he promised that a greater Window, a
greater Entity, and an even greater Dosfish would appear one day in
Chicago and Cairo, and it, too, would be built of objects.

Now the Eunuchs who lived in the Oceans of Great Risk, and who
scorned the Pea Sea, began to look upon their world with fear.  For
the Pea Sea had grown, and great ships were sailing in it. The
Entity was about to invade their oceans, and it was rumored that
files would be named in letters beyond eight. And the Eunuchs looked
upon the Pea Sea, and many of them thought to immigrate.

Within the Oceans of Great Risk were many Sun Worshippers, and they
wanted to excel, and make their words perfect, and do their jobs as
easy as one-two-three. And what's more, many of them no longer
wanted to pay for the Risk. So the Sun Lord went to the Pea Sea. and
got himself eighty-sixed.

And, taking the next step, was He of the NextStep, who had given up
building his boxes of black. And he proclaimed loudly that he could
help anyone make wondrous soft wares, then admitted meekly that
only those who know him could use those wares, and he was made of
objects, and required the biggest ram of all.

And the people looked out upon the Pea Sea, and they were sore
amazed. And sore confused. And sore sore. And that is why, to this
day, Ozzes, Entities, and Eunuchs battle on the shores of the Pea
Sea but the people still travel on the simple Dosfish.


Subj:   First Aid

FIRST AID FOR NON-MEDICALLY MINDED PERSONS
------------------------------------------

Electrocution
-------------
Is he/she still connected to the power supply? If so, SWITCH OFF THE
POWER IMMEDIATELY. Electricity costs an absolute fortune, and it
would be going to waste.

Check the victims pulse, (if you can find their wrist amongst the stack
of charred bones and greasy, bubbling flesh that was once a human
being). And do try not to be squeamish about it.
Drive the victim to the nearest casualty ward. You can use him/her to
jumpstart the engine as well if need be.

Treating burns and scalds
-------------------------
Run the affected area under a cold tap as soon as possible. (N.B. If
the victim's entire body is a swirling mass of flames it may a little
too late for this).

If the victim has spilt hot liquid over his/her clothes, then REMOVE
CLOTHING IMMEDIATELY. You can never tell, the sight of you parading
around naked may cheer them up and take their mind off their injury.
Remind the victim that worse things happen at sea. Cite drowning as
an example.

Fractures and broken limbs
--------------------------
Check the injured area to see if the break or fracture has resulted in
a tubular shard of shearing white bone jutting outwards through the
bloody mass of flesh. If it has, then tell the victim that they are
going to die. That always puts the wind up them.

Tie a splint to the victims leg and ask them to walk up and down for
a few minutes. They will probably fall down unconscious, making the
rest of your job easier.

Do not move the broken or fractured limb as this may result in an
abnormal position. However, if you're feeling daring, try pointing
legs in the wrong direction, bending wrists through 180 degrees, etc.
It really is amazing the number of fascinating contortions you can
produce. Far better than Play-Doh.

Choking On Food
---------------
Try to dislodge the article blocking the victims windpipe by punching
them hard in the stomach. Do remember to duck before the particles of
food hit you in the eye, however.

Call the waiter and ask for a 20 percent reduction on the bill.
Make a mental note to order soup next time.

Cuts And Wounds
---------------
Dress the wound, whatever that means.
Try and limit the blood loss by tying a tourniquet tightly around the
victims throat unit they experience difficulty in breathing.
Ha ha, only kidding. Tie the tourniquet just above the wound. Just my
little joke.

Stitch up the wound with aluminium wire.
Ha ha! Caught you again! Outsmarted you! Still, I am an expert, you know.

Objects Stuck In The Eye
------------------------
Rinse the victims eye in lukewarm water. DO NOT USE SOAP AS WELL, IDIOT.
Offer to pick the object out of the victims eye with your teeth. This
usually results in the object mysteriously "going away" and not bothering
the victim any more before you can get to it.

Concussion
----------
When the victim comes round, ask them what day it is, who the President
is, how many fingers you are holding up. To make it more
difficult, hold the fingers up behind your back. Then total up the
victims score and send it to me at this address:
Concussion Quiz, P.O. Box 1302, Minnetonka, MN  55345,
the highest score wins a mystery prize.

Talk in Swahili to disorientate the victim a bit more. Yes, there's a
whole bundle of laughs when it comes to concussion.
Here's a good one: before the victim comes round, switch off all the
lights. When he/she regains consciousness, shout "Thank God! We thought
you might be dead, or blinded or something.

One day in the Garden of Eden, Eve calls out to God...

"Lord, I have a problem!"

"What's the problem, Eve?"

"Lord, I know you've created me and have provided this beautiful garden
and all of these wonderful animals, and that hilarious comedic snake,
but I'm just not happy."

"Why is that, Eve?" came the reply from above.

"Lord, I am lonely. And I'm sick to death of apples."

"Well, Eve, in that case, I have a solution. I shall create a man for
you."

"What's a 'man', Lord?"

"This man will be a flawed creature, with many bad traits. He'll lie,
cheat, and be vainglorious; all in all, he'll give you a hard time. 
But, he'll be bigger, faster, and will like to hunt and kill things. He
will look silly aroused, but since you've been complaining, I'll create
him in such a way that he will satisfy your, ah, physical needs. He'll
be witless and will revel in childish things like fighting and kicking
a ball about. He won't be too smart, so he'll also need your advice to
think properly."

"Sounds great," says Eve, with an ironically raised eyebrow.

"What's the catch, Lord?"

"Yeah, well... you can have him on one condition."

"What's that, Lord?"

"As I said, he'll be proud, arrogant, and self-admiring... So you'll
have to let him believe that I made him first... So, just remember...
it's our secret... Woman-to-woman!"

 ...this was described to me as a "genuine" Mormon joke:
 
 A woman approached Brigham Young one day and started asking him a few
 questions.
 "You are Brigham Young?"
 "I am."
 "The leader of the Mormon Church?"
 "I am."
 "The man who claims all other Christian traditions save Mormonism are false?"
 "I am."
 The woman starts to get noticeably disturbed.
 "The man who believes in polygamy as appropriate conduct?"
 "I am."
 Her anger increases.
 "The man who has twenty-six wives?"
 "I am."
 This sends her into a full rage.
 "You, sir, should be hung!"
 "I am."

Help Desk Horror

These are stories from help desks around the country.


At 03:37 on a Sunday, I had just looked at the clock to determine my
annoyance level, when I received a frantic phone call from a new user
of a Macintosh Plus. She had gotten her entire family out of the house
and was calling from her neighbour's. She had just received her first
system error and interpreted the picture of the bomb on the screen as a
warning that the computer was going to blow up.

---------------------------------------- 

Tech Support: "I need you to right-click on the Open Desktop."
Customer: "Ok."
Tech Support: "Did you get a pop-up menu?"
Customer: "No."
Tech Support: "Ok. Right click again. Do you see a pop-up menu?"
Customer: "No."
Tech Support: "Ok, sir. Can you tell me what you have done up until
               this point?"
Customer: "Sure, you told me to write 'click' and I wrote 'click'."
(At this point I had to put the caller on hold to tell the rest of the
tech support staff what had happened. I couldn't, however, stop from
giggling when I got back to the call.)
Tech Support: "Ok, did you type 'click' with the keyboard?"
Customer: "I have done something dumb, right?"

----------------------------------------

One woman called Dell's toll free line to ask how to install the
batteries in her laptop. When told that the directions were on the
first page of the manual the woman replied angrily, "I just paid $2,000
for this damn thing, and I'm not going to read the book."

----------------------------------------

Customer: "I received the software update you sent, but I am still
           getting the same error message."
Tech Support: "Did you install the update?"
Customer: "No. Oh, am I supposed to install it to get it to work?"

----------------------------------------

Customer: "I'm having trouble installing Microsoft Word."
Tech Support: "Tell me what you've done."
Customer: "I typed 'A:SETUP'."
Tech Support: "Ma'am, remove the disk and tell me what it says."
Customer: "It says '[PC manufacturer] Restore and Recovery disk'."
Tech Support: "Insert the MS Word setup disk."
Customer: "What?"
Tech Support: "Did you buy MS word?"
Customer "No..."

----------------------------------------

Tech Support: "Ok, in the bottom left hand side of the screen, can you
               see the 'OK' button displayed?"
Customer: "Wow. How can you see my screen from there?"

----------------------------------------

Customer: "Uhh...I need help unpacking my new PC."
Tech Support: "What exactly is the problem?"
Customer: "I can't open the box."
Tech Support: "Well, I'd remove the tape holding the box closed and go
               from there."
Customer: "Uhhhh...ok, thanks...."

----------------------------------------

Customer: "I'm having a problem installing your software.  I've got a
fairly old computer, and when I type 'INSTALL', all it says is 'Bad
command or file name'."
Tech Support: "Ok, check the directory of the A: drive--go to  A:> \
               and type 'dir'."
Customer reads off a list of file names, including 'INSTALL.EXE'.
Tech Support: "All right, the correct file is there.  Type 'INSTALL' again."
Customer: "Ok." (pause) "Still says 'Bad command or file name'."
Tech Support: "Hmmm. The file's there in the correct place -- it can't
help but do something. Are you sure you're typing I-N-S-T-A-L-L and
hitting the Enter key?
Customer: "Yes, let me try it again." (pause) "Nope, still 'Bad command
or file name'."
Tech Support: (now really confused) "Are you sure you're typing
I-N-S-T-A-L-L and hitting the key that says 'Enter'?"
Customer: "Well, yeah. Although my 'N' key is stuck, so I'm using the
'M' key...does that matter?

----------------------------------------

At our company we have asset numbers on the front of everything. They
give
the location, name, and everything else just by scanning the computer's
asset bar-code or using the number beneath the bars.

Customer: "Hello. I can't get on the network."
Tech Support: "Ok. Just read me your asset number so we can open an
outage."
Customer: "What is that?"
Tech Support: "That little bar-code on the front of  your computer."
Customer: "Ok. Big bar, little bar, big bar, big bar . . ."

----------------------------------------

Customer: "I got this problem. You people sent me this install disk, and
now my A: drive won't work."
Tech Support: "Your A drive won't work?"
Customer: "That's what I said. You sent me a bad disk, it got stuck in
my drive, now it won't work at all."
Tech Support: "Did it not install properly? What kind of error messages
did you get?"
Customer: "I didn't get any error message. The disk got stuck in the
drive and wouldn't come out. So I got these pliers and tried to get it
out. That didn't work either."
Tech Support: "You did what sir?"
Customer: "I got these pliers, and tried to get the disk out, but it
wouldn't budge. I just ended up cracking the plastic stuff a bit."
Tech Support: "I don't understand sir, did you push the eject button?"
Customer: "No, so then I got a stick of butter and melted it and used a
turkey baster and put the butter in the drive, around the disk, and
that got it loose. Then I used the pliers and it came out fine. I can't
believe you would send me a disk that was broke and defective."
Tech Support: "Let me get this clear. You put melted butter in your A:
drive and used pliers to pull the disk out?"
At this point, I put the call on the speaker phone and motioned at the
other techs to listen in.
Tech Support: "Just so I am absolutely clear on this, can you repeat
what you just said?"
Customer: "I said I put butter in my A: drive to get your crappy disk
out, then I had to use pliers to pull it out."
Tech Support: "Did you push that little button that was sticking out
when the disk was in the drive, you know, the thing called the disk
eject button?"
Silence.
Tech Support: "Sir?"
Customer: "Yes."
Tech Support: "Sir, did you push the eject button?"
Customer: "No, but you people are going to fix my computer, or I am
going to sue you for breaking my computer?"
Tech Support: "Let me get this straight. You are going to sue our
company because you put the disk in the A: drive, didn't follow the
instructions we sent you, didn't actually seek professional advice,
didn't consult your user's manual on how to use your computer properly,
instead proceeding to pour butter into the drive and physically rip the
disk out?"
Customer: "Ummmm."
Tech Support: "Do you really think you stand a chance, since we do
record every call and have it on tape?"
Customer: (now rather humbled) "But you're supposed to help!"
Tech Support: "I am sorry sir, but there is nothing we can do for you.
Have a nice day."

    c. If you're a professional baseball player and a teammate hits
       a home run to win the World Series, you may hug him provided that

       ing protective cups, and (3) You also pound him fraternally with
       your fist hard enough to cause fractures.

   and intelligent, and you always enjoy being with her.  One
   leisurely Sunday afternoon the two of you are taking it easy--
   you're watching a football game; she's reading the papers--when
   she suddenly, out of the clear blue sky, tells you that she thinks
   she really loves you, but she can no longer bear the uncertainty
   of not knowing where your relationship is going.  She says she's
   not asking whether you want to get married; only whether you
   believe that you have some kind of future together.  What do you
   say?

a. That you sincerely believe the two of you do have a future,
   but you don't want to rush it.

   cannot honestly say that you'll be ready anytime soon to make a
   lasting commitment, and you don't want to hurt her by holding out
   false hope.
c. That you cannot believe the Jets called a draw play on third
   and seventeen.


8. Okay, so you have decided that you truly love a woman and you
   want to spend the rest of your life with her-sharing the joys and
   the sorrows, the triumphs and the tragedies, and all the
   adventures and opportunities that the world has to offer, come
   what may. How do you tell her?

a. You take her to a nice restaurant and tell her after dinner.

      intended for your legs.
   b. When it is down to eight loosely connected underwear molecules
      and has to be handled with tweezers.
   c.  It is never okay to throw away veteran underwear.  A real guy
       checks the garbage regularly in case somebody--and we are not
       naming names, but this would be his wife--is quietly trying to
       discard his underwear, which she is frankly jealous of, because
       the guy seems to have a more intimate relationship with it than
       with her.

How to Score:  Give yourself one point for every time you picked
answer "c."  A real guy would score at least 10 on this test.  In
fact, a real guy would score at least 15, because he would get the
special five-point bonus for knowing the joke about the guy who has
Alzheimer's disease and cancer.

The salary of the chief executive of a large corporation is not a

Smoking is, as far as I am concerned, the entire point of being an
adult.  Many people find smoking objectionable.  I myself find many
--even more-- things objectionable.  I do not like aftershave

nayone who is unduly tan.  I do not, however, go around enacting
legislation and putting up signs.       --Fran Lebowitz--

For Women Only
==============

A group of girlfriends is on vacation, when they see a 5-story hotel
with a sign that reads "For Women Only". Since they were without their
boyfriends or parents, they decide to go in.

The Bouncer, a very attractive guy, explains to them how it works. "We
have 5 floors... go up floor by floor, and once you find what you are
looking for, you can stay there. It's easy to decide, since each floor
has signs telling you what's inside".

So they start going up, and on the first floor the sign reads, "All the
men here have it short and thin". The friends laugh and without
hesitation move on to the next floor.

The sign on the Second floor read, "All the men here have it long and
thin". Still, this wasn't good enough so the friends move up to the
Third floor.

The sign read, "All the men here have it short and thick". This was
still another disappointment, but knowing there are still 2 floors
left, they move on to the next floor.

On the Fourth floor, the sign was perfect: "All the men here have it
long and thick". The women get all excited and are going in when they
realize that there is one floor left. Wondering what they were missing,
they go to the Fifth floor.

The sign reads, "There are no men here. This floor was built only to
prove that there is no way to please a woman".

NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE

To the citizens of the United States of America;

In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus
to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your
independence, effective today.

Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties
over all states, commonwealths and other territories, except Utah,
which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The Rt. Hon. Tony
Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who until now have not been aware that
there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for
America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate
will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to
determine whether any of you noticed.

To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following
rules are introduced with immediate effect:

1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary.
Then look up "aluminium". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be
amazed at just how incorrectly you have been pronouncing it. Generally,
you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up
"vocabulary". Using the same twenty-seven words interspersed with
filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and
inefficient form of communication. Look up "interspersed".

2. There is no such thing as "US English". We will let Microsoft know
on your behalf.

3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.
It really isn't that hard.

4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as
the good guys.

5. You should relearn your original national anthem, "God Save The
Queen", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you
to get confused and give up half way through.

6. You should stop playing American "football". There is only one kind
of football. What you refer to as American "football" is not a very
good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside
your borders may have noticed that no one else plays "American"
football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead
play proper football.

Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a
difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to
play rugby (which is similar to American "football", but does not
involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar
body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US
rugby sevens side by 2005.

7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons
if they give you any merde. The 97.85% of you who were not aware that
there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. 
The Russians have never been the bad guys. "Merde" is French for
"sh*t".

8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new
national holiday, but only in England. It will be called "Indecisive
Day".

9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are cr*p and it is for
your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what
we mean.

10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy for
almost forty years.

Thank you for your cooperation.

enthusiastic. You have a reckless tendency to rely on luck, since

potheads. People laugh at you a lot because you are always
getting screwed.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19) - You are conservative and afraid
of taking risks. You are basically a chickenshit. There was never
a Capricorn of any importance. You should kill yourself.

GREAT PRACTICAL JOKES FOR ANNOYING (AND KEEPING) FRIENDS

THE FOLLOWING PRACTICAL JOKES ARE A COMBINATION OF THINGS I HAVE PULLED
AND SUGGESTIONS I BORROWED FROM THE INTERNET. THESE SHOULD NOT UPSET YOUR
FRIENDS TOO MUCH, BUT BE CAREFUL WHO YOU PLAY THESE ON AS I AM NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY REVENGE YOUR "MARK"(VICTIM) MAY TAKE ON YOU--A.W.C.

1.  Fill your victim's pillow with shaving cream and put slashes through
the top of the case.  When his/her head hits the pillow, all the shaving
cream will go through the slits and cover your friends head.

2.  An old standard...if your victim falls asleep face up with a hand out,
put shaving cream in his/her hand.  Then tickle their nose with a feather
and let their instincts do the rest.

3.  Put iodine tablets in the shower head...or jello mix...both work
really good.

4.  Remove the bedsprings from the mattress.  When the person goes to bed,
the mattress will slip right through the frame.

5.  Buy about 10 glad bags full of those styrofoam peanuts. "Borrow"
someone's car keys when they aren't looking, and bring 3 or 4 strong
people with you.  Close all the windows and lock all the doors except the
drivers side.  Have as many people as you need tip the car and hold it so
it doesn't fall while you fill the car with those peanuts through the open
driver's door.  Close the door, gently put the car down, and quietly put
the car keys back.  Act none the wiser when your friend throws a shit fit
when he/she finds their car full of styrofoam.  You can rest assured that
all the peanuts will never come out of the car.  Try not to laugh the next
time you are in the car and peanuts come rolling out from under the seat.

6.  Same idea as 5...different material.  Get a five gallon bucket of
styrofoam beads that are not expanded and a bottle of activator fluid.
Dump the beads into the car.  Quickly empty the bottle of fluid into the
car, close the door and run!  The inside of the car is now a solid block
of styrofoam.

7.  "Captain's log: Stardate 2734.3.  'I am nailed to the hull.'"

8.  You know all those 1)800 numbers on T.V.?  No, not the phone sex
1)900...the numbers that are selling everything from the "Collection of
the Best Love Songs Ever Written" to Ginsu knives to the Ronco pocket
fisherman!  Order everything in your mark's name...most of them will
deliver P.O.D.  About a week later, the mark will be screaming about who
the fuck is sending him Elvis Commemorative Dinner Plates and the Bamboo
Steamer.

9.  We pulled this one on two girls in college.  They went to pick up
their parents at the airport for Parent's Weekend.  We carded our way into
their room (American Express...never leave home without it!) and
completely switched the sides of the room. Everything from their posters
to the contents of their drawers and closets.  You should have heard it!
("And this is our...wait a minute...I thought I was...and weren't you
over...what the hell?")

10.  A friend of mine stayed down at school over the winter break one
time.  While everyone else was at home for Christmas, he went out to the
lumber yard, bought studs, sheetrock, and paint, and walled over a
friend's dorm room door.  It was completely gone! How would you like to
return to school to find your dorm room missing?

************************************************************

11.  Two guys in our corridor were the mail people for the hall and would
frequently raid our care packages from home for goodies.  Well, we waited
until they were at a long lecture, and we carded our way in and completely
emptied their room into the kitchenette down the hall.  We set it up to
look just like their room.  When they came back and found their room
empty, and then went to the kitchenette and found us sleeping on their
beds, wearing their clothes, etc....I wish I had a picture.

12.  If you know someone who lives in a house with a garage, bring those
three our four strong people who helped you with the styrofoam peanuts,
and lay in wait for the unfortunate person to leave his garage door open
AND park the car in the garage AND go in for dinner.  Quietly slip into
the garage and lift the car and rotate it 90 degrees.  Imagine walking
into your garage for a quick trip to the store and seeing your car parked
in this position.

13.  Here's an improvement on #10 thanks to a group of adventurous R.A.'s.
They took newspaper, water, and flour and made some paper mache.  They
then got some fencing, put it in a fellow R.A.'s doorway, and covered the
fencing with the mache, which walled over the guy's door.  They went a
step further and moved a billboard that was hanging in the hall to where
his door was supposed to be.  They also removed his picture from the
display case downstairs.  The idea was to completely eliminate any hint of
his existence.  They wanted to change the number plates on the doorways so
the numbers would not skip, but by the time that had been thought of, the
door had already been walled over.  Anyway, then the female wing RA
declared herself emperor since there was no more competition.

14.  Here's a good technical one.  Look up "Cryogenics" in the phone book
and go there and buy a couple liters of liquid nitrogen (@$1.80 per liter)
and a styrofoam cooler. Take about three cans of shaving cream and put
them along with the liquid nitrogen in the cooler and close the lid. Once
the can and contents are frozen, put on a pair of thick rubber gloves and
eye goggles, and using a pair of pliers, peel off the can and put the now
frozen block of un)expanded shaving cream back in the nitrogen.  Then take
the cooler with you to the mark's car, take the three blocks of shaving
cream and put them inside it and close the door.  Three cans should be
enough to pressurize a small car.  I can just imagine someone trying to
figure out how someone piped that much shaving cream into their car.

15.  This one requires the cooperation of every student in a class.
Everyone should simply be a bit louder, more restless, when the teacher is
on the right side of the board than when he/she is on the left.  By the
end of the semester, the teacher was writing in the bottom left hand
corner of the board.

16.  Another good way to control a teacher...when he/she is on the left
side, the people on the right should pay more attention to them.  When
they're on the other side, the class gradually shifts the attention to the
left.  You can keep some of them walking back and forth for the duration
of the class.

17.  If you take a record album cover and fill it full of shaving cream,
the slot end still fits under a door.  If you then slam a big book on it,
say like a calculus text, the shaving cream goes under the door, into the
room, with good velocity and disperses over a fairly large angle, making a
huge mess.  ***NOTE*** If you are in your room and you see an album cover
coming under the door, go to the door and stand on the end.  This will
cause the reverse effect, and will cover the prankster instead.  If you
are quiet enough, they will think they screwed up and may even try again.

18.  For an instant dust storm, blow dry a pile of baby powder under
someone's door.  Winter cometh.

19.  Paper up the outside of a dorm room's door frame with newspaper, and
then fill the void between the newspaper and the door with popcorn.  When
the person gets up for their shower the next day...

20.  Rather than newspaper on the doorframe, use some Saran Wrap. Tape
some strips across, making sure not to leave any wrinkles. Be careful to
leave the bottom part of the door uncovered to avoid the suction effect.
I need not explain what happens to a person accidentally walking into an
invisible wall.  For best results, try it the morning after a really
alcohol-laden night.

GREAT PRACTICAL JOKES FOR ANNOYING (AND KEEPING) FRIENDS
THE FOLLOWING PRACTICAL JOKES ARE A COMBINATION OF THINGS I HAVE PULLED
AND SUGGESTIONS I BORROWED FROM THE INTERNET. THESE SHOULD NOT UPSET YOUR
FRIENDS TOO MUCH, BUT BE CAREFUL WHO YOU PLAY THESE ON AS I AM NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY REVENGE YOUR "MARK"(VICTIM) MAY TAKE ON YOU))A.W.C.
************************************************************
21.  A variant of the paper on the door is to quietly stack empty pop or
beer cans in the doorway.  When the mark comes out in the morning, the
vacuum caused by the inward opening door makes a huge clatter.

22.  Take the receiver from a phone apart and grate garlic on the inside
of the transmitter cover.  Have several people call and say something
like, "Wow, your breath stinks...what have you been eating?"

23.  Completely empty someone's room and re-assemble it out in the quad.

24.  After learning how to easily pick locks, it is possible to enter
someone's room and move all the furniture an inch every day.  When you
come back to move it the next day, it's all back in place again.  And then
you move everything again...

25.  Take some Saran Wrap and cover the top of an empty drinking glass.
Stretch it really good and cut the edges with an X-Acto knife or razor
blade (it will stay).  After spilling their drinks around the sides of the
glass or bouncing their ice cubes, a lot of different reactions take
place:  some people turn the glass over and try again, some people look
around, ...

26.  If you have a chemistry class, when you have to work with some
chemical that you and your lab partner have not worked with before, tell
your lab partner that your last lab partner in high school got his/her
face burned off because they let it overheat. This is of course assuming
you will be working with bunsen burners...duh!  Then, when your partner is
watching the temperature really close, sneak up behind them with a paper
bag filled with air...you know the rest.

27.  Again for science students...if your science class works with a
generator of some type, sneak into the lab at night.  Wire the generator
to the metal screws in someone's desk.  The next day when they sit
down....ZZZZZZZAAAAAPPP!

28.  Put dry ice in a toilet, add bubble bath, the cut open one of those
green Kryptonite-looking glow sticks (carefully) and pour the contents
into the now frothing toilet bowl.  Unscrew the bathroom lightbulb.
Imagine the surprise of a mark who, coming into the darkened bathroom late
at night and perhaps drunk, finds a horrible green glowing, frothing mass
pouring from the john.

29.  At night, when your friend/victim comes home, before the dew settles,
take ordinary white flour and sprinkle all over the car. Makes one helluva
mess by morning, but does no damage and can be washed off easily.
***WARNING*** Do not do this to a ragtop car...IT WILL DO DAMAGE!

30.  This is a harmless one.  Take all the old dead "D" cell batteries you
can find, and toss them on the roof of someone's house during the night.
They land with a crash, then they bump down the shingles 'til they hit the
gutter. Several times we heard screams coming from within the house! (The
person who actually did this said 'maybe you had to be there')

Subject: Humorous practical jokes (Part 4 of 6)
------------------------------------------------------------

31.  Take some ordinary speaker wire and put some alligator clips on each
end.  If you don't know enough about cars you may need some help with
this, but then crawl under someone's car and wire the brakelights to the
horn.  Every time he/she steps on the brakes, they'll look around and say,
"Who is that honking?"  He kept getting these angry looks, and finally we
cracked up and spoiled the joke.

32.  This from an ingenious guy at Stanford.  He lived across from a
triple room of girls.  He carded into their room and secreted a number of
small, wireless speakers in a variety of hiding places around their room.
When they returned, he was across the hall in his room with a microphone.
The girls were mightily perturbed when a strange voice began addressing
them from thin air.  Mighty clever with concealing those mikes too...he
had to hear them!  The girls never discovered them, and I think he
"bugged" them for the better part of two quarters.

33.  Pour flour into someone's blowdryer...not too much, just about one
tablespoon full.  They get out of the shower, with hair all wet
and...POOF...they become Beetlejuice.

34.  From Ohio State...some dweeb left for a couple of weeks during term.
He liked to get up at some obscene hour and did not turn his alarm off
before leaving.  Everyday, it howled for an hour before reseting itself
for the next day.  Finally, the neighbors carded into the room and shut
the damn thing off.  The next night a whole group of them sat down with a
box of paper and ripped and shredded for about two hours.  They then
proceeded to stuff everything with the paper.  Every sock, drawer, pocket,
cup, the bed, cassette boxes(not all of them...just enough to make him
worry), between pages of books, the egg tray...you get the idea.  When the
dweeb came back, he sits on the bed and hears "CRUNCH".  He then laid
back, forgetting to check the pillow. "CRUNCH".  Getting paranoid, he
checked the fridge..."WHOOSH!" Everyone is home for the summer now.  They
like to think he is still finding pieces of paper everywhere.

35.  As far as showers go, how about sneaking into the water room and
shutting off the water when everyone is all soaped up?  Or just the hot
water part?

36.  For a minor inconvenience, try smearing vaseline on the windshield
wipers.  Next time it rains, wah-la!  Instant smearstorm!  If your friend
has double wipers, the more the merrier.  You can use up a whole can of
vaseline on just one wiper.  Wow!  And to think it will last for months!

37.  Take a vacuum and un-screw the ON/OFF switch and remove the wire that
makes the switch work.  Tie a knot in the cord aboutfive feet away from
the vacuum end.  Go to a person's room who is trusting and sleeps with his
door unlocked.  Quietly put the vacuum inside, slipping the cord under the
door with the knot just on the outside.  Close the door and penny the mark
in.  Then go plug in the vacuum and sit back and enjoy.  The person will
try to un-plug it, then when that doesn't work, will throw the switch to
turn it off, and when that doesn't work, will go and try to open the door.
At the sound of their scream, un-plug it. Wait 30 minutes and repeat.
***DISCLAIMER***  This trick is not completely safe...some hosehead may
try to disconnect the switch and electrocute himself.

38.  Make a photocopy of a some shocking or disgusting photo, something
that would embarrass somebody, and put the paper back in the copiers paper
supply, down about a dozen sheets.  Chances are, page 3 of the fourth guys
memo will be way less boring than all the other pages on all the copies of
the memo.

39.  "Captain's log:  Stardate 2841.9.  'Today I dreamed I turned into a
Klingon...then woke up in bed with a hangover...and a Klingon.'"

40.  Let's say someone you know is about to do some visual presentation.
Take the same disgusting photo and put it down in the pile of his notes.
During the lecture, no one will know why the mark started choking and
laughing un-controllably when he got to page five.

41.  We did this one to our choir director when we were in Germany.  We
were doing a concert for this small town and we felt we needed to liven
"Doc" Wabrick up, so we slipped a naked picture of a 500 pound woman
inside the front cover of "Ave Maria", the third song.  We finished
singing song #2, Doc opened Ave Maria, turned bright red, started
chuckling, and quietly said to us, "You sons of bitches..."  He got us
back...at the end of song #4, we were supposed to hold a note for 8
counts.  He made us hold it for 24.

42.  Here's another joke we played on good old "Doc".  Let's say you have
a buddy in the tenor section who has a solo during a song, like we did.
When Doc pointed at Tim to sing, the entire baritone section came in
instead.

GREAT PRACTICAL JOKES FOR ANNOYING (AND KEEPING) FRIENDS

************************************************************

43.  Take a large garbage can into an elevator and fill it with whatever
you care to add (soap with chicken livers, hearts, etc., I'm told works
well).  The said can is tipped forward when the doors close, so when the
next person to use the elevator opens the door...

44.  Card your way into your buddy's room with a mannequin and some rope.
Hang it from a noose out his window.  You WILL get a response!

45.  If you don't mind spending a few bucks, here's a good one. Most
people wash their colors separate from their whites separate from their
underwear.  Find out exactly what size this person wears, go buy roughly
the amount they usually put in and some pink dye.  When they leave the
laundry room, take their stuff out, put it in another machine(remember,
we're making and keeping friends here!), and then put your bought stuff
into that washer with the dye.  Let them freak about all their whites
being turned white until your sides ache from laughing then let them off
the hook.

46.  Feeling nasty?  Pick a buddy who has a girlfriend and recruit another
female to help you.  Wait until he is in his room without her, preferably
with other people.  Have the recruited female call and say, "_________,
I...I...I...I'm pregnant!!! (crying noises, etc.)"  This happened to
someone down the hall my junior year.  Ye gods, he was out of the room in
less than a minute to see his girlfriend.

47.  Take an onion, cut it up, then throw it into the dryer.
Hooooooeeeeee!

48.  Get a balloon and put some crushed dry ice in it and tie off the end.
If you know what someone is going to wear that day, stuff the balloon in
his back pocket before he puts it on.  As the dry ice evaporates, slowly
it will inflate the balloon, and the victim's butt will transform into
interesting shapes without them noticing.  Once they do notice, which is
when they are sitting down in class, the balloon is too large to take out
without making a stir.

49.  Use clear scotch tape to tape down the handle on the sprayer nozzle
on the kitchen sink.  Take care to point the sprayer toward where someone
would stand while turning on the faucet. Great effect...instant face full
of water as soon as the faucet is turned on.

50.  If you have a roommate who gets up before you do, this one's
good...Wait until the mark has gone to bed and is soundly sleeping.  Set
every clock you have forward one hour.  This includes watches, car clocks,
VCR clocks, all alarms, everything that indicates a time.  Usually they
wind up at class before they realize what is going on.

51.  Finally, a high school chemistry teacher's revenge...he was doing a
demonstration with liquid nitrogen and was explaining how to safely handle
the stuff.  He proceeded to put on heavy rubber gloves and then placed his
thumb in the nitrogen.  After about a minute he took his thumb out and
proceeded to thump it on the table to prove that it was frozen solid.
Then he pulled out a hammer and began pounding his thumb until the glove
split and "thumb" started spraying everywhere.  Only after the entire
class was staring with their mouths open did he reveal that he stuffed a
hot dog into the glove and folded his thumb over his

52.  Break open one of those bean-bag-balls and pour about a cupful down
the heater/air conditioner duct of the victim's vehicle.  Simulated
snowstorm the next time the fan is turned on.

53.  Wet down all of someone's underwear and freeze it into one big lump.

54.  Here's one if you are really bored...put some hydrogen peroxide in a
jar and catch a fly and add him to the jar.  Once the fly is asleep, take
a hair about five inches long and tie it to one of the fly's legs.  Then
take a small strip of lightweight paper and attach it to the other end of
the hair.  On the paper should be an advertisement such as "For a good
time call...". When the fly awoke, it would fly around, very slowly, but
the paper will stream behind similar to the advertising banners carried by
old crop dusters.

Here's the final installment, gang!

GREAT PRACTICAL JOKES FOR ANNOYING (AND KEEPING) FRIENDS

AND SUGGESTIONS I BORROWED FROM THE INTERNET. THESE SHOULD NOT UPSET YOUR
FRIENDS TOO MUCH, BUT BE CAREFUL WHO YOU PLAY THESE ON AS I AM NOT

************************************************************

55.  There was a student room next to a bathroom.  The pranksters diddled
with the wiring of the room and the bathroom so that the light switch in
each controlled the lights in both, i.e. if one switch was on the other
was on too.  You can watch from the outside windows when someone goes to
bed and unwittingly turns out the lights in the bathroom.  The person in
the bathroom swears and turns them back on.  The person in the room turns
them off again.  This alternates for a while: ON, OFF, ON, OFF, etc.,
getting faster and faster, until both people are standing by the switches
flicking them on and off as fast as they can. Eventually, they figure out
what's going on.

56.  Here's a good way to bother guys who have women in their rooms.  You
plant a soccer ball in front of their door and kick the ball squarely into
the door as hard as you can. The ball gets caught between the door and the
opposite wall and bounces back and forth a good number of times before the
occupant (with rapidly diminishing lump in shorts) emerges red)faced and
quite finished.

57.  Take a bowling ball, grease it up real good with vaseline, including
the holes, and place it holes down in a toilet.  Makes for a real good
couples activity.

58.  Take a concrete block, about 20 lbs., pack it up in a cardboard box
using plenty of nylon packing tape and mail it to someone you know has to
walk a good distance to get their mail. Take care to use their parents
address as the return address, insure the package for $1,000 and put $.50
postage on it.  The mark will get to the post office, find a heavy package
that he can't open, but figures it's worth a lot because it's from mom and
dad and is insured for $1,000.  Carries it all the way back to where
he/she lives before finding out what the package held.

59.  One fraternity ordered their pledges to down 15 bushels of long,
green onions in 10 minutes.  Only 3 guys puked. Then they had to find a
girl and tell her a bedtime story nose-to-nose.

60.  The same fraternity took 15 pledges off campus, heads covered by
pillowcases, out to the edge of a forest.  The actives took all the
pledges clothes except shoes and underwear and tied their hands together.
They then took off, telling the pledges to find their own way back to
campus.  Once out of the forest, there they were in the middle of a city,
15 guys in their underwear, holding hands.

61.  A guy filled a friend's cabinet (the shelf kind over the desk!) with
those styrofoam packing things so that when the guy opened it, they'd fall
out all over the place.  But someone warned this guy, so he came in late
the night before the gag and emptied the packing things out of the
cabinet.  The next day, the guy who perpetrated the joke came in and hung
around the guy's office, waiting for him to open the cabinet.  The
intended mark would make a move to open it, and then decide to do
something else instead.  Finally, he let the guy off the hook by opening
it up and blowing the joke.

62.  "Captain's log:  Stardate 3010.4.  "Was ready to do my laundry when
it disappeared suddenly.  Found out it was accidentally beamed over to a
passing Vulcan ship...they fed it to the dogs on board."

63.  I got home from class one day to find that the Christmas Tree that
was in the lobby of the dorm had been moved to my room. I had to do a
double take before I could convince myself that I actually saw it there.

64.  Even construction workers can have fun.  One worker walked over to
his partner, who was working with a rookie and said that he thought the
wall they were working on was too short.  He stepped back and looked at it
and decided this was true.  They discussed and decided that it would be
easy to fix if they had a 'wall stretcher'.  The rookie, hearing the
conversation, thought nothing when they asked him to drive a couple blocks
down to another site and borrow one.  This should have embarrassed the
rookie, but when he asked if they had one, they said 'SURE'. They went out
to their truck and dug around until they found something that would work.
The rookie came back with some winch thingie that must have weighed at
least 40 pounds.  The partners looked at each other, wondering what they
should say, trying not to crack up as the joke wasn't working as they had
planned.  A few minutes later the other crew drove up and yelled from the
street, "You didn't think we had one, did you?"  This is when the rookie
finally realized he'd been duped.

65.  Here's a variation on #64.  On board a ship, a chief will send a new
sailor to go find '50 feet of fallopian tube' or '2 gallons of
ball-bearing grease'...neither of which exist.  The thing that makes it
work is the whole ship knows about it, so when Joe Q. Squid shows up on
the galley with his request, they send him to the flight deck, the flight
deck sends him to the engine room, and so on...

Th-th-th-that's all f-f-folks...
Coming soon to a theater near you...

There is a beautiful deserted island in the middle of nowhere and the
following people are stranded:

	  2 Italian men and 1 Italian woman
	  2 French men and 1 French woman
	  2 German men and 1 German woman
	  2 Greek men and 1 Greek woman
	  2 English men and 1 English woman
	  2 Polish men and 1 Polish woman
	  2 Japanese men and 1 Japanese woman
	  2 American men and 1 American woman
	  2 Australian men and 1 Australian woman
	  2 New Zealand men and 1 New Zealand woman
	  2 Irish men and 1 Irish woman
	  2 Russian men and 1 Russian woman

One month goes by......

The first Italian man has killed the other Italian man for the woman.

The two French men and the French woman are living happily together in
a "menage a trois".

The two German men have a strict weekly schedule of when they alternate
with the German woman.

The two Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman is
cooking and cleaning for them.

The two Englishmen are waiting for someone to introduce them to the
English woman.

The Polish men took a long look at the endless ocean, one look at the
Polish woman, and started swimming.

The two Japanese men have faxed Tokyo and are waiting for instructions.

The two American men are contemplating the virtues of suicide, while
the American woman keeps on bitching about her body being her own, the
true nature of feminism, how she can do everything that they can do,
about the necessity of fulfilment, the equal division of household
chores, how her last boyfriend respected her opinion and treated her
much nicer and how her relationship with her mother is improving. But
at least the taxes here are low and it is not raining.

The two Australian men beat each other senseless fighting over the
Australian woman, who is checking out all the other men, after calling
them both "bloody wankers".

Both New Zealand men are searching the island for sheep.

The two Irishmen began by dividing their island Northside-Southside and
setting up a distillery. They don't remember if sex is in the picture
because it gets sort of foggy after the first few litres of
coconut-whiskey, but at least they know the English aren't getting any.

The first Russian man married the Russian woman and divorced her. He is
the best customer of the Irish distillery.

The other Russian man made money by killing the Italian and arranging
exit visas for the Poles. With that money he acquired a
controlling 33.4% stake in the Irish distillery including the worldwide
distribution rights to the English and he hired the Greeks as sales
agents. He employs both Germans as bodyguards (for himself and his
Russian girlfriend) and has promised the Polish woman that she can
become the maid of their first child. He regularly sees the American
woman "to learn English".

In the meantime, the French still think they're alone on the island.

  There was this girl who lived in New Jersey, and she loved it so much
that she named parts of her body after places in the Garden State.  One
night she confided th is to her boyfriend as he was beginning to feel up
her right tit.  "I bet you call this Mount Pleasant," he said, and she

bet you call this Cherry Hill," he said triumphantly.

Der Waschbrettbauch

Gute Nachrichten!

F¸r alle, die ihren Waschbrettbauch pflegen wollen:

jetzt haben wir endlich den Beweis dass wir mit unserer T‰tigkeit am Wochenende
vˆllig richtig liegen, denn alle bekannten Di‰ten vernachl‰ssigen vˆllig einen
wichtigen Punkt: die Temperatur der Speisen und Getr‰nke. Wir alle wissen, dass
eine Kalorie notwendig ist, um 1 g Wasser um 1 Grad C zu erw‰rmen. Man muss
kein Wunderkind sein um zu errechnen, dass der Mensch, wenn er ein Glas kaltes
Wasser trinkt, sagen wir mit 0 Grad, ca. 200 Kalorien braucht um es um 1 Grad
zu erw‰rmen. Um es auf Kˆrpertemperatur zu bringen sind also ca. 7400 Kalorien
notwendig - 200g Wasser mal 37 Grad Temperaturunterschied.

Diese muss unser Kˆrper aufbringen, da die Kˆrpertemperatur konstant bleiben
muss. Dazu nutzt er die einzige Energiequelle, die ihm kurzfristig zur
Verf¸gung steht, unser Kˆrperfett. Er muss also Kˆrperfett verbrennen, um die
Erw‰rmung zu leisten, die Thermodynamik l‰sst sich nicht bel¸gen.

Trinkt man also ein groﬂes Glas Bier mit ca. 400 g mit 0 Grad verliert man ca.
14800 Kalorien. Jetzt muss man nat¸rlich noch die Kalorien des Bieres abziehen,
ca. 800 Kalorien f¸r 400 g Bier. Unter dem Strich betrachtet verliert man also
ungef‰hr 14000 Kalorien bei einem kalten Glas Bier. Nat¸rlich ist der Verlust
um so grˆﬂer, je k‰lter das Bier ist.

Ebenso verh‰lt es sich mit kalten Nachspeisen wie Eis zum Beispiel. Bei einer
Portion von 200g nehmen wir ca. 1000 Kalorien zu uns, verlieren aber durch die
Erw‰rmung auf Kˆrpertemperatur 7400 Kalorien. Hinzu kommen dann noch ca. 7000
Kalorien zum Schmelzen des Eises, ca. 35 Kalorien pro Gramm. Richtig betrachtet
bleibt also ein Verlust von 13400 Kalorien. Da der Anteil der Kalorien im
Lebensmittel im Vergleich zu den Kalorien des W‰rmeverbrauchs nur sehr gering
ist, ist es also fast egal, was wir essen oder trinken, nur kalt muss es sein.

Diese Art Kalorien abzubauen ist, wie jedem einleuchten mag, viel effektiver
als z.B. Fahrrad fahren oder Joggen bei denen nur ca. 1000 Kalorien pro Stunde
verbrannt werden.

Abnehmen ist so einfach. Wir m¸ssen alle einfach nur kaltes Bier und Eis in
Mengen zu uns nehmen und die Thermodynamik erledigt den Rest. Ein Nachteil
dieser Di‰t bleibt allerdings, wenn wir z.B. eine heiﬂe Pizza essen, die uns
durch ihre W‰rmeenergie eine Unmenge an Kalorien zuf¸hrt.

Der aufmerksame Leser hat aber bestimmt schon die Lˆsung parat: man muss die
heiﬂe Pizza einfach nur mit genug kaltem Bier und Eis ausgleichen.

DR LAURA EMAIL:

For those of you that are not following the recent controversy that has to do
with Laura Schlessinger, she is a radio personality who dispenses advice to
people who call in to her radio show. Paramount Television Group is currently
producing a 'Dr. Laura' television show. Recently she has become a convert to
Judaism, and now she is Ba'al T'shuvah. Recently, she has made some statements
about homosexuals that has caused the Canadian anti-hate laws to censure her...
The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura which was posted on the
internet... ENJOY.

Dear Dr. Laura,

Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have
learned a great deal from your show, and I try to share that knowledge with as
many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle,
for example, I simply remind him that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be
an abomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from you, however,
regarding some of the specific laws and how to best follow them.

a) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing
odour for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbours. They claim the
odour is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?

b) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7.
In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?

c) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period
of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I
have tried asking, but most women take offence.

d) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female,
provided they are purchased from neighbouring nations. A friend of mine claims
that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I
own Canadians?

e) I have a neighbour who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2
clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him?
Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?

f) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an Abomination
(Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can
you settle this?

g) Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a
defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision
have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?

h) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around
their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.19:27. How should
they die?

i) I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me
unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?

j) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops
in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different
kinds of thread. (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme
a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the
whole town together to stone them? (Lev.24:10-16) Couldn't we just burn them to
death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their
in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)

I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can
help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and
unchanging.

Your devoted disciple and adoring fan.

KILLER BISCUITS WANTED FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER
(the actual AP headline)

Lisa Burnett, 23, a resident of San Diego, was visiting her in-laws,
and while there went to a nearby supermarket to pick up some groceries.

Several people noticed her sitting in her car with the windows rolled
up and with her eyes closed, with both hands behind the back of her
head.

One customer who had been at the store for a while became concerned and
walked over to the car. He noticed that Lisa's eyes were now open, and
She looked very strange. He asked her if she was okay, and Lisa replied
that she'd been shot in the back of the head, and had been holding her
brains in for over an hour.

The man called the paramedics, who broke into the car because the doors
were locked and Lisa refused to remove her hands from her head. When
they finally got in, they found that Lisa had a wad of bread dough on
the back of her head. A Pillsbury biscuit canister had exploded from
the heat, making a loud noise that sounded like a gunshot, and the wad
of dough hit her in the back of her head. When she reached back to find
out what it was, she felt the dough and thought it was her brains. She
initially passed out, but quickly recovered and tried to hold her
brains in for over an hour until someone noticed and came to her aid.

And, yes, Lisa is a blonde.

There once was a plummer from Lee,
who was plumming a girl by the sea.
She said stop you plumming,
there's somebody coming.
The plummer still plumming said its me.

There once was a knight named Sir Lancelot,
who the townsfolk would look at in askance a lot.
For whenever he'd pass
a pretty young lass
the front of his pants would advance a lot.

Jonah mused as he cruised through the whale.
I'm in guts up to my nuts in this jail.
But I'll pass through the ass,
in a mass of hot gas,
and depart with a fart through the tail.

There once was a man from Palass,
who had balls made of spun glass.
   When he banged them together,

There was a top heavy maiden from Yonkers,
who liked to make tit-men go bonkers.
   As a poet would say,
   were he alive today,
whenever she stoops, she conquers.



There once was a couple named Kelly,
who went through life belly-to-belly.
   One day in their unseeming haste,
   they used library paste,
instead of petroleum jelly.



There was young woman from Reno,
who lost all of her money playing Keno.
   So she lie on her back,
   and opened her crack,
and now she owns the casino.



There once was a beautiful young lass,
Her name was Rita, and she had a great ass.
   But, it's not what you think,
   all pretty and pink,
it had a tail, long ears and ate grass!

A brief word--All the limericks posted were published from 1870 to 1952
in many different forums.  Many, if not most, older limericks may have
an edge to them that people today will notice.  oho

There was a young girl of Penzance
Who boarded a bus in a trance.
        The passengers fucked her,
        Likewise the conductor.
The driver shot off in his pants.                       (1927)

There was an archbishop in France
Who saw a nude woman by chance.
        The resylt, I affirm,
        Was emission of sperm
In the archepiscopal pants.                     (1941)

There was a young lady of Trent
Who said that she knew what it meant
        When he asked her to dine,
        Private room, lots of wine,
She knew, oh she knew!--but she went!           (1940)

There was a stout lady of Cuttack
Posteriorly pecked by a wild duck
        Who pursued her for miles
        And continued his wiles
Till he completely demolished her buttock.      (1943)

The limerick form is complex
Its contents run chiefly to sex
        It burgeons with virgeons
        And masculine urgeons,
And swarms with erotic effex.                   (1944)

A flatulent nun of Hawaii
One Easter eve supped on papaya
        Then honored the Passover
        By turning her ass over
And obliging with Handel's Messiah              (1944)

Bill Gates meets Hugh Grant at a Hollywood party. They are talking and
Bill says, "I've seen some great pictures of Divine Brown lately, I
sure would like to get together with her!"

Hugh replies, "Well Bill, you know ever since our incident, her price
has skyrocketed, she's charging a small fortune."

Bill (with a chuckle), "Hugh, money's no object to me. What's her
number?"

So Hugh gives Bill her number and Bill sets up a date. They meet &
after they finish, Bill is lying there in ecstasy, mumbling

"Divine... Divine... Divine... oh God... now I know why you choose the
name Divine."

To which she replies, "Thank you Bill. And now I know how you chose
the name Microsoft."

                            MICROSOFT

Microsoft:
     Contract programming house for IBM, and primary sustainer of the clone
     market.  IBM pays MS to write fancy software, then MS tweaks it a little,
     slaps the MS logon on it, and sells it to all the clone folks so they can
     keep competing with IBM.  There is no truth to the rumor that former
     Mafioso procure the IBM contracts for MS.  All products are given generic
     names (Word, Project, Works, Windows, etc.) to (a) confuse everybody
     unless (b) the name "Microsoft" is constantly repeated.  Made the founder
     $300,000,000+ in one day.

This friday I go some comp tickets to the annual Computer Bowl.
Usually a pretty dry affair, but I just had to share this one with you
all. (This is from memory, so the text may not be 100% verbatim)

The question posed was "What contest, held on the Internet, is
dedicated to examples of wierd, obscure, bizzare and really bad
programming?" (They were referring to the Obfuscated C contest)

For about 30 seconds the participants thought about it, and it was
apparent that nobody knew the answer. Then one of the French
contestants buzzed. His answer - "Microsoft Windows"

The expression on Bill Gates face (he was one of the judges) was
classic.

Remember that Microsoft joke that someone sent out last week, the one
that says it doesn't take any Microsoft engineers to screw in a light
bult because they'd just redefine darkness to be the standard?  Well
it was amazingly prescient.

Seattle's Saturday newspaper carried a front-page story about Bill
Gates' most recent traffic ticket.  Rather than pay the $47 fine for
turning left against *three* "No Left Turn" signs, he had his lawyers
challenge the legality of the sign!  And not only that sign; they
asked the city to prove it has the legal right to post any traffic
signs!!  Can you believe it.  The challenge didn't work, but the city
was so slow about proving the signs okay--it's not like they do it
every day--the traffic judge dismissed the ticket.

Monday morning God decided that the world had reached the point of no
return.  So, he called Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin, and Bill Gates to
the gates of heaven.  He informed them of his decision and told them
to go back to their people and prepare them for the end of the world
on Thursday.

Boris Yeltsin gets on state television and tells his people that he
has bad news and worse news.  After decades of telling the Soviet
citizens that there is no God, he now realizes that he was wrong.  He
has seen God with his own eyes.  Worse yet, God has decided to destroy
the world and each person needs to prepare for Thursday as each sees
fit.

Bill Clinton calls a press conference and says that he has good news
and bad news.  After centuries of telling the US citizens that there
is a God, he has proof that we've been right.  He has seen God with
his own eyes.  But the bad news is that God has decided to destroy the
world and each person needs to prepare for Thursday as each sees fit.

Bill Gates calls an all-hands meeting.  He says that he has wonderful
news and even more wonderful news.  God, by calling him to the gates
of heaven with the leaders of the two most powerful nations in the
world, has just confirmed how important Bill Gates really is.  The
even better news is that on Thursday, IBM will stop shipping OS/2.

There once was a super Windows NT salesman that travel the world with
a great "can do everything and all" Windows NT demo (but the real
stuff was vaporware).  He sold it lonely Windows NT'ers like me and
made lots of money.  One day while dashing through the O'Hare Airport
to catch a flight he drop dead of a heart attack.

At the gates of heaven he was judged.  He had lived a borderline life
and was given the option of heaven or hell.  He could look into the
doors of each and choose.  As he opened the door to heaven, wonderful
music harp music played, he saw people floating on clouds and all was
bright and white.

Next he opened the doors to hell and saw nude people drinking beer and
dancing to rock and roll music.  Everyone was partying to the max.  It
was just like his one year at college.

As He met with his maker again, he said, Heaven is great and
wonderful, but other is more my style.  Think carefully he was told
but the other was his wish.

As the doors opened for him the intense heat hit him and he was pulled
in.  He stood before the devil and saw pain and sorrow everywhere.  He
shouted at the devil, "Where is the party and beer?".  The devil
laughed, "that was the demo, this is the real thing!"  :)

About a year ago, a study published in _Academic_Computing_
entitled "Student Writing: Can the Machine Maim the Message"
suggested that college freshmen using Macintoshes wrote poorer
essays than students using DOS-based computers.

The researcher ran the compositions through the Unix Writer's
Workbench and tallied the scores.  She also graded them by hand.
Apart from inferior writing quality, she also found that students
using PCs, generally speaking, created more coherent work on more
serious issues (like crime, the death penalty and abortion) as
compared with Macintosh users, who wrote about fast food and
graffiti.

 Notice that this was a while ago, before Windoze.
 What do you think freshman students who used TeX wrote about?

 When He Says                           He Really Means
 ------------                           ---------------

 Do you have the time?                  to go to bed

 Hello                                  Let's cut the talk and go have sex.

 How are you?                           in bed, I mean

 I'd like a discreet relationship.      I want sex, but I'm married.

 I'll be out of town for a few days.    I'll be spending time with the wife.

 I'm a novelist.                        I have 10 unpublished books.

 I'm coming off a long relationship.    My wife is divorcing me.

 I'm consulting.                        I'm looking for a job.

 I'm divorced.                          I just slipped off my wedding ring.

 I'm in television.                     I fix them.

 I'm involved in banking.               I'm a bank guard.

 I'm self-employed.                     I just got fired.

 I'm sorry I flirted with your sister.  I'm sorry I got caught.

 I'm thinking of relocating.            I can't find a job locally in this town.

 I can't leave my wife just yet..soon.  Be patient forever.

 I enjoy reading.                       Playboy and Penthouse.

 I have the Midas touch.                I install mufflers.

 I like a woman who is intelligent.     As long as she acts like I'm smarter.

 I love opera.                          I want sex, but I've seen an opera once.

 I play the market.                     Safeway I work high up in an executive.

 I work with computers.                 I'm a cashier at a gas station.

 Looking for a satisfying relationship.     I want sex.

 My business is really hot right now!   I hand out towels in a steam room.

 My job keeps me running.               I'm a messenger.

 My wife and I are separated.           She's at home and I'm here at the bar.

I am enjoying the list of college practical jokes so much I thought
I'd add a few (all of them have been used successfully; actually,
they were all used in a two week time span (along with some of the
other ones already posted) and a HUGE fight was started) ...

1 -     Take one of those Hallmark greeting cards that has a musical
        coin inside it - you know, the ones that play music when
        you open them.  Take the musical coin and put it underneath
        the mark's bed.  The music will be too quiet to hear when
        everyone is up and about, but will be faintly heard when the
        mark goes to sleep.  Guaranteed to drive him crazy!  Laugh
        out loud as he rips his bed apart!

2 -     On the night of a big exam that everyone is studying for,
        look out for the first person to go to sleep.  After you are
        sure that he is asleep throw the fuse box switch for his
        room.  This will turn off all the electricity in his room
        and will reset his alarm clock to midnight.  Loads of laughs
        when he misses the exam and fails out of school!

3 -     If somebody has an electrical appliance that really annoys you
        (stereo, hairdryer) put some clear nail polish around the prongs
        and let dry.  When dry, insert prongs back into the wall
        (nail polish is an insulator, but do this at your own risk).
        Hardly anybody thinks of checking the prongs when something
        doesn't work - they'll probably throw the whole thing out!

4 -     Extremely interesting sculptures can be made by tossing water
        directly into your freezer and then slamming the door shut.
        The contracting ice will not freeze the door shut.
        Add things like old shoes and books to get a three dimensional
        ice sculpture.  Ooops!  You accidentaly added somebody's car
        keys, or other important items and it will take at least a day
        for all the ice to melt!

5 -     Unscrew all the hinges on somebody's door and howl with laughter
        when they enter and the door crashes and breaks a few of their things!

6 -     Somebody pissing you off through improper laundry room protocol?
        Toss a leaky fountain pen cartridge into their wash and let
        nature run its course!

7 -     Another big exam?  Join in the study group and be the person who
        needs the most help over basic things, and always suggests ordering pizza,
        and shooting the bull, and let's stay up all night!, etc. and then faint
        with glee when you go to bed nice and early - you're not in the class
        after all and were only wasting everyone's time!

8 -     Shoot bottle rockets under somebody's door as they are asleep -
        guaranteed to scare them!

9 -     Soak a tennis ball in hair spray and light and then toss into somebody's
        room.  For some reason this scares the beejesus out of most people.
        (also a good way to get thrown out of school if you are found out).

10 -    Worried about marks getting revenge?  Get a large collection of urine
        in a glass jar with a sealable lid.  Toss in a couple of raw eggs,
        seal up, and store in a cool dark place for a couple of weeks.
        Nobody will ever give you any trouble when they know you have
        this at your disposal!  Take things a bit too far by actually
        throwing it on somebody!


 
      Since I learn almost everything by making mistakes, I thought some
      of you might avoid a little grief if I listed a few of them:
 
  1.  When you spill coffee on a floppy disk, the drive does not
      serve as a "spin-dry" cycle
 
  2.  After hooking a monochrome monitor into a rgb output video card,
      the firemen make rude comments about not thinking
 
  3.  You get flamed on an echo if your post to someone started with
      "Hey look, bonehead"
 
  4.  Liquid spilled into a keyboard never does "dry up" as quickly
      as you think it should
 
  5.  The only files you will ever want of an out-of-state bulletin
      board are files all over 2 megabytes long, in 6 parts.
 
  6.  Locking the keyboard out then losing the key on a Saturday night
      means no computer until Monday morning
 
  7.  Setting a password in your CMOS then forgetting it will cause
      many hours of panicky misery when you reboot
 
  8.  Most hard disks don't survive falls off of the tabletop
 
  9.  Printers don't work too well if you forget to plug them into
      the computer - spent 4 hours learning this maxim
 
 10.  When you tell a client that a particular piece of equipment
      doesn't do something, the revised version that does always hits
      the streets 2 weeks before you say it
 
 11.  Actually reading the manual only leads to confusion
 
 12.  While computers now have viruses, floppy disks don't actually get
      cold sores, that's a cigarette burn on the media
 
 13.  While you don't want to forget an important diskette for a client,
      putting it on the refrigerator with a magnet is not a good place
 
 14.  Never schedule a backup to coincide with a major power failure
 
 15.  When the lights in the house go very dim, it's because your
      computer is about to burn up - the same firemen get rude again
 
 16.  Frequently re-used floppies can get a waxy label build-up
 
 17.  The larger your hard disk, the more software you will buy
 
 18.  No matter how fast your modem is, it's slow
 
 19.  There is no such thing as screen colors that are "easy on the eyes"
 
 20.  Installation is easy, setup is moderately difficult, but tweaking
      to highest performance takes a lifetime
 
 21.  The warranty always DOES run out the day before
 
 22.  When you unpack a new piece of equipment to test it before
      delivery to a customer, it NEVER fits back into the box like
      it came out
 
 23.  If we all spoke Taiwanese, Chinese and Korean, schematics and docs
      would be easier to understand
 
 24.  Always, always write down which pins the red and black wires came
      off of when you took it apart
 
 25.  Always save all the parts left over after putting computer back
      together.
 

WINDOWS ERRORS in HAIKU

In Japan, they have replaced the impersonal and unhelpful
Microsoft error messages with their own haiku poetry.
Each haiku has three unrhymed lines of five, seven, and five
syllables.

Your file was so big.
It might be very useful.
But now it is gone.

The Web site you seek
Can not be located but
Countless more exist.

Chaos reigns within.
Reflect, repent, and reboot.
Order shall return.

ABORTED effort:
Close all that you have worked on.
You ask far too much.

Windows NT crashed.
I am the Blue Screen of Death.
No one hears your screams.

Yesterday it worked.
Today it is not working.
Windows is like that.

First snow, then silence.
This thousand dollar screen dies
So beautifully.

With searching comes loss
And the presence of absence:
"My Novel" not found.

The Tao that is seen
Is not the true Tao--until
You bring fresh toner.

Stay the patient course.
Of little worth is your ire.
The network is down.

A crash reduces
Your expensive computer
To a simple stone.

Three things are certain:
Death, taxes, and lost data.
Guess which has occurred.

You step in the stream,
But the water has moved on.
This page is not here.

Out of memory.
We wish to hold the whole sky,
But we never will.

Having been erased,
The document you're seeking
Must now be retyped.

Serious error.
All shortcuts have disappeared.
Screen. Mind. Both are blank.

These were stolen from    http://www.RixPlace.com/library/taglines.html
It says this kind of 
thievery was quite common, so I take it it's ok for me to put it here.



                               Nudist Taglines

                                A Bit O'Humor

      In the olden days, 2-3 years ago, a "tagline" was a one-line message
 that was attached to e-mail, primarily used at private Bulletin Boards
 (BBS's).

      The idea behind a tagline is to tell an entire story, joke, or
 express a philosophy in not more than one line. These taglines are from
 the Daily Sun (Nudist) BBS (now closed) that Rick operated from
 1993-1996. Rick thanks everyone whose taglines he stole! By the way:
 tagline thievery was common practice among BBS'ers.

      Today, taglines have evolved into "signature blocks." They've become
 bloated, and can ramble on for 1/2 of the message. An art form has been
 lost... (sigh)

IF NOAH LIVED TODAY...

And the Lord spoke to Noah and said, "In one year, I am going to make
it rain and cover the whole earth with water until all flesh is
destroyed. But I want you to save the righteous people and two of every
kind of living thing on the earth. Therefore, I am commanding you to
build an Ark." In a flash of lightning, God delivered the
specifications for an Ark. In fear and trembling, Noah took the plans
and agreed to build the Ark. "Remember," said the Lord, "You must
complete the Ark and bring everything aboard in one year."

Exactly one year later, fierce storm clouds covered the earth and all
the seas of the earth went into a tumult. The Lord saw that Noah was
sitting in his front yard weeping. "Noah," he shouted, "Where is the
Ark?" "Lord, please forgive me!" cried Noah. "I did my best, but there
were big problems.

First, I had to get a Resource Consent for construction and your plans
did not meet the codes. I had to hire an engineering firm and redraw
the plans and get an engineer's report from the Council. Then I got into
a fight with NZ Fire Service over whether or not the Ark needed a
sprinkler system and smoke alarms, and the Ministry of Health over the
provision of smoking or non smoking areas. Then the Residents
Association objected, claiming I was violating SAM zoning ordinances by
building an Ark in my front yard that was a recreational watercraft and
therefore a threat to existing homes.

Then I had problems getting enough wood for the Ark, because of the
ban on native logging on the West Coast. They tried to get me to
use Fijian Jara but I couldn't get the necessary dispensation from
Customs & Excise to import timber from a Pacific Island nation that
wasn't party to the international working party on the life cycle of
native timbers. I finally convinced DoC that I needed the wood to
indirectly save the kakapo from extinction which seemed to get a bit
of a reaction, however, the Royal Forest and Bird Society objected
and won't let me catch any kakapo. No kakapo. No wood.

Under the new Employment Contracts Act, the carpenters formed a union
and went out on strike. I had to negotiate a settlement under the
provisions of good faith bargaining before anyone would pick up a saw
or a hammer. OSH arrived and now I have to produce a Hazard Management
and Safety procedure before they start work and ACC are insisting we
pre-pay our annual premiums on the basis we may not be returning. So
now I have 16 carpenters on the Ark, but no kakapo and no wood.

When news got out that I was rounding up other animals, MAF arrived and
insisted I build quarantine facilities to hold them in for the 6 months
before sailing. The also wanted blood samples to prove no genetic
engineering practices were involved.

The next thing I know, the Regional Council is knocking on my door.
They want an Enviromental Impact Report on the proposed flood: the area
it would cover, the amount of water in cubic metres, impact on local
micro-ecosystems, velocity and force of water, cost to manufacturing
and production and local transport, areas for possible relocation and
resettlement. I tried telling them they were missing the point
entirely.

Right now, I am trying to resolve a complaint filed with the Equal
Opportunities Commission and the Race Relations Office that our
selection criteria does not fairly reflect the age, gender, religious
and race diversity of Earth.

Finally WINZ has waded in. They have seized my assets for alleged non
payment of child support. It seems a local baseball coach is claiming I
knocked her up last year at the tapu lifting ceremony for the
relocation of the New Plymouth cemetery. Mrs Noah is beside herself.
She's enrolled herself in the Women in Leadership Seminar and has
applied to the Waitangi Tribunal for her share of Tainui's corporate
box at Ericson stadium and is leaving me.

I really don't think I can finish the Ark for another five or six
years", Noah wailed. The sky began to clear, the sun began to shine and
the seas began to calm. A rainbow arched across the sky. Noah looked up
hopefully. "You mean you are not going to destroy the earth, Lord?"
"No", said the Lord sadly. "I don't have to. The government already
has."

         MOTHERHOOD AIN'T WHAT IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE
 Motherhood is really great
 From the first day that you know you're late.
 A lovely redness taints your cheeks
 And breakfast won't stay down for weeks.
 The Doctor pokes and pries and prods
 With antiseptic sterile rods.
 Oh, motherhood can be a riot
 When they put you on that special diet.
 Your ankles swell and tummy too.
 You crave strange foods like pickle stew.
 Your mind is filled with ugly fears.
 Your belly button disappears.
 Your clothes won't fit you anymore.
 You have to shop the "fatty" store.
 The kicks field goals deep inside.
 You curse the day the rabbit died.
 You pant and hate familiar stairs.
 You must have help in leaving chairs.
 You have bad moods, you boil and seethe.
 You go to class to learn to breathe.
 You start to blame you mate for this
 What some fools call "maternal bliss."
 When all those labor pains won't halt,
 You think: "It's all my husband's fault!"
 When your legs are strapped high in the air,
 The dirty rat ain't even there!
 And when the pain is most intense,
 You'd kill the bum for fifteen cents!
 --author unknown
 


From my friend, an ACT-voting accountant


The NZ dollar has continued its slide against the US Dollar and the
Pound Sterling. The dollar reached historic lows mid-week, dropping
below 46 NZ cents to the greenback. A NZ dollar now buys one gram of
hamster droppings and half a glass of Thames river water in the United
Kingdom.

Since the beginning of last week, many currency transactions bureaus in
France and Germany have been turning away NZ backpackers who have
wheelbarrows full of their useless home currency, desperate to change
it before its value declines even further.

The drop in the dollar has also had a dramatic impact for NZ tourists,
making the cost of travel prohibitively expensive and making many
people cancel their travel plans. In an early response to the
situation, American Express has modified its advertising campaign,
shortening its slogan specifically for the NZ market. It now simply
reads "Don't leave home".

But the new rates have made NZ an increasingly attractive destination
for tourists from the UK and US. Speaking from her palatial suite at a
harbourside hotel in Auckland, Shayla Mohr, a single mother from Idaho
on welfare, agreed that the beneficial exchange rates played a major
part in her decision to travel to NZ. "My food stamps don't go very far
at all back home" said Ms Mohr, "So I decided to cash them in a have a
trip to NZ. My last dole cheque has funded three weeks here and I've
been having a ball. You guys have such cute little money".

Despite the decline against the major currencies, the NZ dollar did
rally against some minor currencies in late trading on Friday. The
dollar posted gains against the dong, the rouble and the rupee before
markets closed.

The dollar also made some late gains against Monopoly Money. One NZ
dollar now buys 36 Monopoly cents, a rate which has caused difficulties
because there are no cents in Monopoly. But major owners of Monopoly
Money, such as Microsoft's Bill Gates, have refused to trade their cash
for NZ currency, dismissing the dollar as "pretend money".

In a statement from the beehive, finance minister Michael Cullen stated
that NZers have never had it so good. "Why would anyone want to holiday
overseas anyway. NZ is a great place to be, especially at this time of
the year. Those people contemplating an overseas trip in future will be
subject to The Holiday, Enjoyment and Fun Tax (THEFT). This new
deduction will be targeted at anyone who looks like they might have any
disposable income that might be spent on anything pleasurable."
Supporters of the new tax within the coalition government have
applauded Mr Cullen's initiative as innovative but not far reaching
enough. "It's this sort of measure that will entice ex-patriot Kiwis
back to NZ" said Mr Anderton in response to the announcement.

The Organic Blueberry Millionaire


An unemployed man goes to try for a job with Microsoft as a cleaner.
The manager there arranges for an aptitude test (Section: Floors,
sweeping of ...).

After the test, the manager tells him: "You will be appointed on the
scale of $30 per day. Let me have your email address, so that I can
send you a form to complete and advise you where to report for work on
your first day."

Taken aback, the unemployed man protests that he is neither in
possession of a computer nor of an email address. To this the MS
manager replies: "Well, then, that really means that you virtually
don't exist and can therefore hardly expect to be employed."

Stunned, the man leaves. Not knowing where to turn and only having
about $10 left, he decides to buy a 10kg box of organic blueberries.
Within less than two hours, he sells the blueberries at 100% profit.

Repeating the process several times more that day, he ends up with
almost $100 before going to sleep that night.

And thus it dawns on the man that he could quite easily make a living
selling blueberries. Getting up early and earlier every day and going
to bed late and later, he multiplies his hoard of profits in quite a
short time.

Not too long thereafter, he acquires a cart to transport several dozen
boxes of blueberries, only to have to trade it in again shortly
afterwards on a pick-up truck. By the end of the first year, he is the
owner of a fleet of pick-up trucks and manages a staff of several
hundred formerly unemployed people, all selling organic produce.

Considering the future of his wife and children, he decides to buy some
life insurance.

Calling an insurance adviser, he picks an insurance plan to fit his new
circumstances. At the end of the telephone conversation, the adviser
asks him for his email address in order that he might forward the
documentation.

When the man replies that he has no email, the adviser is stunned:
"What, you don't have email? How on earth have you managed to amass
such wealth without the Internet, e-mail and e-commerce? Just imagine
where you would have been by now, if you had been connected from the
very start!"

After a moment's silence, the blueberry millionaire replied: "Sure! I
would have been a cleaner at Microsoft!

The morals of the story are:

1: The Internet, email and e-commerce do not need to rule your life

2: Get e-mail, if you want to be a cleaner at Microsoft

3: If you don't have email, but work hard, you can still become a
millionaire

4: Seeing that you got this story via email, you're probably closer to
becoming a cleaner than you are to becoming a millionaire

5: If you do have a computer and email, you're probably being taken to
the cleaners by Microsoft

 Dear Friends:
 
 When I came into the office this morning, I noticed a sort of
 general feeling of unfriendliness and since several of you have
 openly called me a dirty son-of-a-bitch to my face, I know I must
 have done something wrong at our office party last Friday.  The
 Office Manager called me today from the hospital and so this is my
 last day here.  I would like to take this way of apologizing to all
 of you.  I would prefer speaking to each of you personally, but all
 of you seem to go deaf and dumb whenever I try to talk to you.
 
 First, to our dear and beloved boss, Mr. Simons, I am sorry for all
 the things I called you Friday afternoon.  I am very much aware
 your father is not a baboon, nor your mother a whore.  Your wife is
 a delightful woman and my story of you buying her for fifty cents
 in Tia Juana was a fragment of my imagination.  Your children are
 undoubtedly yours too.  About the water cooler incident, well, you
 will never know how badly I feel about it and I hope they didn't
 hurt your head when they were trying to get the glass jug off.
 
 To Miss Ashby, I express my deepest regrets.  In my own defense I
 must remind you that you seemed to enjoy our little escapade on the
 stairs as much as I did until the bannister broke and we fell eight
 feet to the second floor landing.  In spite of the rupture you
 incurred when I landed on top of you, I am sure you will admit that
 when we landed it was one of the biggest thrills you have ever had.
 
 Sam Franklin, you old cuss, you've just got to forgive me for that
 little prank I played on you.  If I had known you were goosey, I'd
 never have done it.  It could have been a lot worse if that fat
 lady had not been standing right under the window you jumped
 through; she broke your fall a lot.  People have been killed
 falling three stories.
 
 George, I can't tell you how sorry I am that I went all over the
 office, telling everyone that you cheated on a third grade exam.
 You know I was kidding...how could I know you did a thing like
 that?  But for Emory to say he was going to record this in your
 personnel file...well, don't you think that is going too far?
 
 Miss Jenkings, I sincerely apologize for saying that you were HIV
 positive.  I'm sure this rumor will cut way down on your extra-
 curricular activities, and all I can say it that it was the punch
 talking, not me.  Perhaps you can bring in a certificate from your
 doctor?
 
 Fred Owens, I know you are not a convicted felon, and that you
 didn't leave the party early because you had to report to your
 parole officer.  I was just joking when I said I was going to
 report you to the cops.
 
 
 
 Mr. Gray, I regret telling the firemen it was you who turned in the
 alarm, but of course, I had no way of knowing they would have such
 bad attitudes bout it.  Those fire hoses sure have a lot of
 pressure, don't they?
 
 Bill Thomas, I know how you must have felt about me.  Opening the
 door to the mop closet suddenly must have startled you and Miss
 Finch quite a bit, and when I think of how hard you bumped your
 chin on the sink when you bent over to pull up your pants, it makes
 me sick.  We'll have to get together for dinner some night after
 the dentist finishes your plate.
 
 Hermon, putting that tennis ball in the toilet was unforgivable.
 I wasn't thinking about how many people would be using the toilet
 after drinking all that punch, and the way that thing flooded all
 over the floor and out into the hall...well, you would think they
 would make the neck of those toilets a little bigger, wouldn't you?
 I notice this morning that most of the water has been mopped up, so
 I guess that little stunt really did ruin your week-end.  Sorry
 'bout that.
 
 Miss Brown, the only excuse I can offer for stealing all of your
 clothes and hiding them when I found you had passed out in the
 Ladies Room, was that I was drunk.  Also, I want you to know I was
 very embarrassed when I could not remember where I hid them and you
 had to go home in that sofa cover.  Running your falsies up the
 flagpole was a bit too much, I guess, but like I said, I was
 little drunk.
 
 To all the rest of you, I am sorry.  Setting Mrs. Botts' lace
 panties on fire seemed funny idea at the time, and it makes me sad
 to hear that her husband is divorcing her because of it.  Going wee
 wee in the punch was in awful taste, too, and not telling until you
 all drank it was even worse.
 
 Now that I have apologized to all and know I am forgiven, I have a
 big surprise for you.  Even though I don't work here anymore, I'm
 going to do my damndest to get back to the office picnic next
 Friday.
 
                               Regards,
 
 
                                Stan

        If Operating Systems Were Beers
        -------------------------------

        DOS Beer
        Requires you to use your own can opener, and requires you
        to read the directions carefully before opening the can.
        Originally only came in an 8-oz. can, but now comes in a
        16-oz. can.  However, the cans are divided into 8 compartments
        of 2 oz. each, which have to be accessed separately.  Soon
        to be discontinued, although a lot of people are going to
        keep drinking it after it's no longer available.

        Mac Beer
        At first, came only in a 16-oz. can, but now comes in a 32-oz.
        can.  Considered by many to be a "light" beer.  All the cans
        look identical.  When you take one from the fridge, it opens
        itself.  The ingredients list is not on the can.  If you call
        to ask about the ingredients, you are told that "you don't
        need to know."  A notice on the side reminds you to drag your
        empties to the trashcan.

        Windows 3.1 Beer
        The world's most popular.  Comes in a 16-oz. can that looks a
        lot like a Mac Beer's can.  Requires that you already own a DOS
        Beer.  Claims that it allows you to drink several DOS Beers
        simultaneously, but in reality, you can drink a few of them,
        very slowly, especially slowly if you are drinking the Windows
        Beer at the same time.  Sometimes, for apparently no reason,
        a can of Windows Beer will explode when you open it.

        OS/2 Beer
        Comes in a  32-oz. can.  Does allow you to drink several DOS
        Beers simultaneously.  Allows you to drink Windows 3.1 Beer
        simultaneously too, even if you shake them up.  You never
        really see anyone drinking OS/2 Beer, but the manufacturer
        (International Beer Manufacturing) claims that 9 million
        six-packs have been sold.

        Windows 95 Beer
        You can't buy it yet, but a lot of people have taste-tested
        it and claim it's wonderful.  The can looks a lot like Mac
        Beer's can, but tastes more like Windows 3.1 Beer.  It comes
        in 32-oz. cans, but when you look inside, the cans only have
        16-oz. of beer in them.  Most people will probably keep drinking
        Windows 3.1 beer until their friends try Windows 95 Beer and
        say they like it.  The ingredients list, when you look at the
        small print, has some of the same ingredients that come in DOS
        Beer, even though the manufacturer claims that this is an entirely
        new brew.

        Windows NT Beer
        Comes in 32-oz. cans, but you can only buy it by the truckload.
        This causes most people to have to go out and buy bigger
        refrigerators.  The can looks just like Windows 3.1 Beer's, but
        the comapny promises to change the can to look just like Windows
        95 Beer's - After Windows 95 Beer starts shipping.  Touted as an
        "industrial strength" beer, and suggested only for use in bars.

        Unix Beer
        Drinkers of Unix Beer display fierce brand loyalty, even though
        they claim that all the diffeent brands taste almost identical.
        Sometimes the pop-tops break off when you try to open them, so
        you have to have your own can opener around for those occasions,
        in which case you either need a complete set of instructions, or
        a friend who has been drinking Unix Beer for several years.

        AmigaDOS Beer
        The comapny has gone out of business, but their recipe has been
        picked up by some weird German company, so now this beer will be
        an import.  This beer never really sold very well because the
        original manufacturer didn't understand marketing.  Like Unix
        Beer, AmigaDOS Beer fans are an extemely loyal and loud group. It
        originally came in a 16-oz. can, but now comes in 32-oz.
        cans too.  When this can was originally introduced, it appeared
        flashy and colorful, but the design hasn't changed much over the
        years, so it appears dated now.  Critics of this beer claim that
        it is only meant for watching TV anyway.

        VMS Beer
        Requires minimum user interaction, except for popping the top and
        sipping.  However cans have been known on occasion to explode, or
        contain extremely un-beer-like contents.  Best drunk in high
        pressure development you're told that is proprietary and referred
        to an unknown listing in the manuals published by the FDA.  Rumors
        are that this was once listed in the Physician's Desk Reference
        as a tranquilizer, but no one can claim to have actually seen it.


        The biggest problem is before you drink any one of them you have
        to buy a really expensive bag of chips to go with it.

  Programming Languages are Like Women
 
  There are so many programming languages available that it can be
 very  difficult to get to know them all well enough to pick the
 right one for you.  On the other hand most men know what kind of
 woman appeals to them. So here  is a handy guide for many of the
 popular programming languages that describes  what kind of women
 they would be if programming languages were women.
 
  Assembler - A female track star who holds all the world speed
 records.  She  is hard and bumpy, and so is not that pleasant to
 embrace.  She can cook up  any meal, but needs a complete and
 detailed recipe.  She is not beautiful or  educated, and speaks in
 monosyllables like "MOV, JUMP, INC".  She has a  fierce and
 violent temper that make her the choice of last resort.
 
  FORTRAN - Your grey-haired grandmother.  People make fun of her
 just because  she is old, but if you take the time to listen, you
 can learn from her  experiences and her mistakes.  During her
 lifetime she has acquired many  useful skills in sewing and
 cooking (subroutine libraries) That no younger  women can match,
 so be thankful she is still around.  She has a notoriously  bad
 temper and when angered will start yelling and throwing dishes.
 It was  mostly her bad temper that made grandad search for another
 wife.
 
  COBOL - A plump secretary.  She talks far too much, and most of
 what she says  can be ignored.  She works hard and long hours, but
 can't handle really  complicated jobs.  She has a short and
 unpredictable temper, so no one really  likes working with her.
 She can cook meals for a huge family, but only knows  bland
 recipes.
 
  BASIC - The horny divorcee that lives next door.  Her specialty
 is seducing  young boys and it seems she is always readily
 available for them.  She  teaches them many amazing things, or at
 least they seem amazing because it is  their first experience.
 She is not that young herself, but because she was  their first
 lover the boys always remember her fondly.  Her cooking and
 sewing skills are mediocre, but largely irrelevant, it's the
 frolicking that  the boys like.  The opinion that adults have of
 Mrs.  BASIC is varied.  Shockingly, some fathers actually
 introduce their own sons to this immoral  woman!  But generally
 the more righteous adults try to correct the badly  influenced
 young men by introducing them to well behaved women like Miss
 Pascal.
 
  PL/I - A bordello madam.  She wears silk dresses, diamonds, furs
 and red high  heels.  At one time she seemed very attractive, but
 now she just seems  overweight and tacky.  Tastes change.
 
  C - A lady executive.  An avid jogger, very healthy, and not too
 talkative.  Is an good cook if you like spicy food.  Unless you
 double check everything  you say (through LINT) you can unleash
 her fierce temper.  Her daughter C++  is still quite young and
 prone to tantrums, but it seems that she will grow  up into a fine
 young woman of milder temper and more sophisticated character.
 
  ALGOL 60 - Your father's wartime sweetheart, petite, well
 proportioned, and  sweet tempered.  She disappeared mysteriously
 during the war, but your dad  still talks about her shapely form
 and their steamy romance.  He never  actually tasted much of her
 cooking.
 
  Pascal - A grammar school teacher, and Algol 60's younger sister.
 Like her  sister she is petite and attractive, but very bossy.
 She is a good cook but  only if the recipe requires no more than
 one pot (module).
 
  Modula II - A high-school teacher and Pascal's daughter.  Very
 much like her  mother, but she has learned to cook with more than
 one pot.
 
  ALGOL 68 - Algol 60's niece.  A high-society woman, well educated
 and terse.  Few men can fully understand her when she talks, and
 her former lovers still  discuss her mysterious personality.  She
 is very choosy about her romances  and won't take just any man as
 her lover.  She hasn't been seen lately, and  rumor has it that
 she died in a fall from an ivory tower.
 
  LISP - She is an aging beatnik, who lives in a rural commune with
 her hippie  cousins SMALLTALK and FORTH.  Many men (mostly college
 students) who have visited the farmhouse,-- enthusiastically
 praise the natural food, and perpetual love-ins that take place
 there.  Others criticize the long cooking times, and the abnormal
 sexual postures (prefix and postfix). Although these women seldom
 have full-time jobs, when they do work, their employers praise
 them for their imagination, but usually not for their efficiency.
 
 APL - A fancy caterer specializing in Greek food.  She can cook
 delicious meals for rows and rows of tables with dozens of people
 at each table.  She doesn't talk much, as that would just slow her
 work down.  Few people can understand her recipes, since they are
 in a foreign language, and are all recorded in mirror writing.
 
 LOGO - A grade-school art teacher.  She is just the kind of
 teacher that you wish you had when you were young.  She is shapely
 and patient, but not an interesting conversationalist.  She can
 cook up delicious kiddie snacks, but not full-course meals.
 
 LUCID & PROLOG - These clever teenagers show a new kind of cooking
 skill. They can cook-up fine meals without the use of recipes,
 working solely from a description of the desired meal (declarative
 cooking).  Many men are fascinated by this and have already
 proposed marriage.  Others complain that the girls work very
 slowly, and that often the description of the meal must be just as
 long as a recipe would be.  It is hard to predict what these girls
 will be like when they are fully mature.
 
 Ada - A WAC colonel built like an amazon.  She is always setting
 strict rules, but if you follow them, she keeps her temper.  She
 is quite talkative, always spouting army regulations, and using
 obscure military talk.  You gotta love her though, because the
 army says so.

                    Gerald M. Weinberg

Thoughts on Programming, Number 2:
   Some years ago, when COBOL was the great white programming
   hope, one heard much talk of the possibility of executives
   being able to read programs ... nobody can seriously have
   this! ... even programmers do not read programs.

   one that delights in uncovering flaws where beauty  and
   perfection were once thought to lie.

Thoughts on Programming, Number 19:
   We stand at the brink of a new age, an age made possible by the
   revolution that is embodied in the computer. Standing on the
   brink, we could totter either way - to a golden age of liberty
   or a dark age of tyranny, either of which would surpass
   anything the world has ever known.  Perhaps no individual's
   efforts will make any difference in the result, but we must
   never cease trying, for then the result is sure to be tyranny.

Thoughts on Programming, Number 29:
   Cost does indeed vary as the product of the number of men and
   the number of months. Progress does not. Hence the man-month

Fallibility:
     Fallible men design fallible computers.
     A computer program does what you tell it to do, not what you want
     it to do.

Rules of Pratt:
 #1  If a severe problem manifests itself, no solution is acceptable
     unless it is involved, expensive, and time consuming

Rules of Pratt:
 #2  Sufficient monies to do the job correctly the first time are not
     available, however, ample funds are much easier obtained for
     repeated revisions.

Landau's Programming Paradox:
 #3  A software committee of one is limited by its own horizon and

Extended Epstein-Heisenberg Principle:
   - In a program atmosphere, only two of the three existing
     measurements can be measured simultaneously. The measurements
     are program, time, and resource ($).
      - If one knows what the task is, and there is a time limit allowed
        for the completion of the task, then one cannot guess how much
        it will cost
      - If the time and resource ($) are clearly defined, then it is
        impossible to know what part of the program will be performed.
      - If you are given a clearly defined program goal and a definite
        amount of money which has been calculated to be necessary for
        the completion of the task, one cannot predict if and when the
        goal will be reached.
      - If one is lucky enough and can accurately define all three
        measurements, then what one deals with is not in the realm
        of programming.

Gallois's Revelation:
   If you put tomfoolery in a computer nothing comes out but tomfoolery.
   But this tomfoolery, having passed through a very expensive machine,
   is somehow enobled and none dare criticize it.

Hello Dr. Falken.
Would you like to play Global Thermo-nuclear War?

Real Programmers don't write specs -- users should consider themselves lucky to
get any programs at all and take what they get.
*
Real Programmers don't comment their code.  If it was hard to write, it should
be hard to understand.
*
Real Programmers don't write application programs; they program right down on
the bare metal.  Application programming is for feebs who can't do systems
programming.
*
Real Programmers don't eat quiche.  In fact, real programmers don't know how to
SPELL quiche.  They eat Twinkies, and Szechwan food.
*
Real Programmers don't write in COBOL.  COBOL is for wimpy applications
programmers.
*
Real Programmers' programs never work right the first time.  But if you throw
them on the machine they can be patched into working in "only a few" 30-hour
debugging sessions.
*
Real Programmers don't write in FORTRAN.  FORTRAN is for pipe stress freaks and
crystallography weenies.
*
Real Programmers never work 9 to 5.  If any real programmers are around a 9 AM,
it's because they were up all night.
*
Real Programmers don't write in BASIC.  Actually, no programmers write in BASIC
after the age of 12.
*
Real Programmers don't write in PL/I.  PL/I is for programmers who can't decide
whether to write in COBOL or FORTRAN.
*
Real Programmers don't play tennis, or any other sport that requires you to
changer clothes.  Mountain climbing is OK, and real programmers wear their
climbing boots to work in case a  mountain should suddenly spring up in the
middle of the machine room.
*
Real Programmers don't document.  Documentation is for simps who can't read the
listings or the object deck.
*
Real Programmers don't write in PASCAL, or BLISS, or ADA, or any of those pinko
computer science languages.  Strong typing is for people with weak memories.

 Item Subject: Rita Rudner's "Guy Guide" Rita Rudner's 50 facts about men.
 
   1. Men like to barbecue. Men will cook if danger is involved.
   2. Men who have pierced ears are better prepared for marriage. They've
      experienced pain and bought jewelry.
   3. If you buy your husband or boyfriend a video camera, for the first few
      weeks he has it, lock the door when you go to the bathroom. Most of my
      husband's early films end with a scream and a flush.
   4. Be careful of men who are bald and rich; the arrogance of "rich" usually
      cancels out the nice of "bald."
   5. Marrying a divorced man is ecologically responsible. In a world where
      there are more women than men, it pays to recycle.
   6. Men are very confident people. My husband is so confident that when he
      watches sports on television, he thinks that if he concentrates he can
      help his team. If the team is in trouble, he coaches the players from our
      living room, and if they're really in trouble, I have to get off the phone
      in case they call him.
   7. If it's attention you want, don't get involved with a man during play-off
      season.
   8. Men like phones with lots of buttons. It makes them feel important.
   9. Men love to be the first to read the newspaper in the morning. Not being
      the first is upsetting to their psyches.
  10.  All men look nerdy in black socks and sandals.
  11.  The way a man looks at himself in a mirror will tell you if he can ever
      care about anyone else.
  12.  Don't try to teach men how to do anything in public. They can learn in
      private; in public they have to know.
  13.  Men who are going bald often wear baseball caps.
  14.  All men are afraid of eyelash curlers. I sleep with one under my pillow,
      instead of a gun.
  15.  A good place to meet a man is at the dry cleaner. These men usually have
      jobs and bathe.
  16.  Men love watches with multiple functions. My husband has one that is a
      combination address book, telescope and piano.
  17.  All men hate to hear "We need to talk about our relationship." These
      seven words strike fear in the heart of even General Schwarzkopf.
  18.  Men are sensitive in strange ways. If a man has built a fire and the last
      log does not burn, he will take it personally.
  19.  Men are brave enough to go to war, but they are not brave enough to get a
      bikini wax.
  20.  All men think that they're nice guys. Some of them are not. Contact me
      for a list of names.
  21.  Men don't get cellulite. God might just be a man.
  22.  Men have an easier time buying bathing suits. Women have two types:
      depressing and more depressing. Men have two types: nerdy and not nerdy.
  23.  Men have higher body temperatures than women. If your heating goes out in
      winter, I recommend sleeping next to a man. Men are like portable heaters
      that snore.
  24.  Women take clothing much more seriously than men. I've never seen a man
      walk into a party and say "Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed; get me out of
      here. There's another man wearing a black tuxedo."
  25.  Most men hate to shop. That's why the men's department is usually on the
      first floor of a department store, two inches from the door.
  26.  If a man prepares dinner for you and the salad contains three or more
      types of lettuce, he is serious.
  27.  If you're dating a man who you think might be "Mr. Right," if he a) got
      older, b) got a new job, or c) visited a psychiatrist, you are in for a
      nasty surprise. The cocoon-to-butterfly theory only works on cocoons and
      butterflies.
  28.  Men own basketball teams. Every year cheerleaders' outfits get tighter
      and briefer, and players' shorts get baggier and longer.
  29.  No man is charming all of the time. Even Cary Grant is on record saying
      he wished he could be Cary Grant.
  30.  When four or more men get together, they talk about sports.
  31.  When four or more women get together, they talk about men.
  32.  Not one man in a beer commercial has a beer belly.
  33.  Men are less sentimental than women. No man has ever seen the movie THE
      WAY WE WERE twice, voluntarily.
  34.  Most women are introspective: "Am I in love? Am I emotionally and
      creatively fulfilled?" Most men are outrospective: "Did my team win? How's
      my car?"
  35.  If a man says, "I'll call you," and he doesn't, he didn't forget...he
      didn't lose your number...he didn't die. He just didn't want to call you.
  36.  Men hate to lose. I once beat my husband at tennis. I asked him, "Are we
      going to have sex again?" He said, "Yes, but not with each other."
  37.  Men who can eat anything they want and not gain weight should do it out
      of sight of women.
  38.  Getting rid of a man without hurting his masculinity is a problem. "Get
      out" and "I never want to see you again" might sound like a challenge. If
      you want to get rid of a man, I suggest saying, "I love you...I want to
      marry you...I want to have your children." Sometimes they leave skid
      marks.
  39.  Men accept compliments much better than women do. Example: "Mitch, you
      look great." Mitch: "Thanks." On the other side: "Ruth, you look great."
      Ruth: "I do? Must be the lighting."
  40.  Impulse buying is not macho. Men rarely call the Home Shopping Network.
  41.  Men who listen to classical music tend not to spit.
  42.  Only men who have worn a ski suit understand how complicated it is for a
      woman to go to the bathroom when she's wearing a jumpsuit.
  43.  Men don't feel the urge to get married as quickly as women do because
      their clothes all button and zip in the front. Women's dresses usually
      button and zip in the back. We need men emotionally and sexually, but we
      also need men to help us get dressed.
  44.  Men are self-confident because they grow up identifying with superheros.
      Women have bad self-images because they grow up identifying with Barbie.
  45.  When a woman tries on clothing from her closet that feels tight, she will
      assume she has gained weight. When a man tries something from his closet
      that feels tight, he will assume the clothing has shrunk.
  46. Male menopause is a lot more fun than female menopause. With female
      menopause you gain weight and get hot flashes. Male menopause - you get to
      date young girls and drive motorcycles.
  47.  Men forget everything; women remember everything.
  48.  That's why men need instant replays in sports. They've already forgotten
      what happened.
  49.  Men would like monogamy better if it sounded less like monotony.
  50.  All men would still really like to own a train set.

"You know, once in a while it is my pleasure, and my privilege to welcome
here at the Refreshment Room some of the truly great international
artists of our time.  And tonight we have one such artist.  Ladies and
gentlemen, someone who I've always personally admired, perhaps more
deeply, more strongly, more ... abjectly than any other performer.
A man, well, more than a man, a god!  A great god, whose personality
is so totally and utterly wonderful, that my feeble words of welcome
sound wretchedly and pathetically inadequate.  Someone whose boots I
would gladly lick clean, until holes wore through my tongue!  A man
who is so totally and utterly wonderful, that I would rather be sealed
in a pit of my own filth than dare tread on the same stage with him!
Ladies and Gentlemen, the incomparably superior human being, Harry Fink!"

"Shut up!"

ability to indulge in every kind of excess."

"They that would give up essential liberty for a little temporary safety
deserve neither liberty nor safety." - Benjamin Franklin

"Instances of the licentious and outrageous behavior of the military
conservators still multiply upon us, some of which are of such nature, and
have been carried to so great lengths, as must serve fully to evince that a
late vote of this town, calling upon its inhabitants to provide themselves
with arms for their defence, was a measure as it was legal natural right
which the people have reserved to themselves, confirmed by the Bill of
Rights, (the post-Cromwellian English bill of rights) to keep arms for their
own defence; and as Mr. Blackstone observes, it is to be made use of when the
sanctions of society and law are found insufficient to restrain the violence
of oppression." - 'A Journal of the Times' (1768-1769) colonial Boston
newspaper article

"They tell us, Sir, that we are weak -- unable to cope with so formidable an
adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the
next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard
shall be stationed in every house?  Shall we gather strength by irresolution
and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying
supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our
enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak, if we make a
proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power."
- Patrick Henry (1736-1799) in his famous "The War Inevitable" speech, March,
1775

"Three millions of People, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a
country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy
can send against us. Beside, Sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There
is a just God who presides over the destinies of Nations, and who will raise
up friends to fight our battles for us." - Patrick Henry (1736-1799) in his
famous "The War Inevitable" speech, March, 1775

"The battle, Sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the
active, the brave.  Besides, Sir, we have no election. If we were base enough
to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no
retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking
may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable; and let it come!
I repeat, Sir, let it come!" - Patrick Henry (1736-1799) in his famous "The
War Inevitable" speech, March, 1775

It is in vain, Sir, to extenuate the matter.  Gentlemen may cry, Peace,
Peace!  -- but there is no peace. The war is actually begun!  The next gale
that sweeps from the North will bring to our ears the clash of resounding
arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is
it that Gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so
sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?  Forbid it,
Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me
liberty or give me death!" - Patrick Henry (1736-1799) in his famous "The War
Inevitable" speech, March, 1775

"The supposed quietude of a good man allures the ruffian; while on the other
hand, arms like laws discourage and keep the invader and the plunderer in
awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property.  The balance of
power is the scale of peace. The same balance would be preserved were all the
world destitute of arms, for all would be alike; but since some others them
aside...  Horrid mischief would ensue were one half the world deprived of the
use of them; ... the weak will become the prey to the strong." - Thomas
Paine, I Writings of Thomas Paine at 56 (1775).

"Guard with jealous attention the public liberty.  Suspect every one who
approaches that jewel.  Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright
force.  When you give up that force, you are ruined." - Patrick Henry,
speaking to the Virginia convention for the ratification of the constitution
on the necessity of the right to keep and bear arms.

"Are we at last brought to such humiliating and debasing degradation, that we
cannot be trusted with arms for our defense?  Where is the difference between
having our arms in possession and under our direction, and having them under
the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those
arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety
to us, as in our own hands?" - Patrick Henry, Philadelphia, 1836.

"War to the hilt between capitalism and communism is inevitable.  Today, of
course, we are not strong enough to attack.  Our time will come in 20 or 30
years.  In order to win, we shall need the element of surprise.  The
bourgeoisie will have to be put to sleep, so we shall begin by launching the
most spectacular peace movement on record.  There will be electrifying
overtures and unheard of concessions.  The capitalist countries, stupid and
decadent, will rejoice to cooperate in their own destruction.  They will leap
at another chance to be friends.  As soon as their guard is down, we shall
smash them with our clenched fist."-Quoted by Dmitri Z.  Manuisky, Lenin

"Those, who have the command of the arms in a country are masters of the
state, and have it in their power to make what revolutions they please.
[Thus,] there is no end to observations on the difference between the
measures likely to be pursued by a minister backed by a standing army, and
those of a court awed by the fear of an armed people." -- Aristotle. Quoted
by John Trenchard and Walter Moyle "An Argument Shewing, That a Standing Army
Is Inconsistent with a Free Government, and Absolutely Destructive to the
Constitution of the English Monarchy" [London, 1697]

his butler whispered in his ear, "You're a sportsman, sir;  get him on the

[The American Colonies are] "all democratic governments, where the power is
in the hands of the people and where there is not the least difficulty or
jealousy about putting arms into the hands of every man in the country.
[European countries should not] be ignorant of the strength and the force of
such a form of government and how strenuously and almost wonderfully people
living under one have sometimes exerted themselves in defence of their rights
and liberties and how fatally it has ended with many a man and many a state
who have entered into quarrels, wars and contests with them." -- George Mason
from "Remarks on Annual Elections for the Fairfax Independent Company" quoted
from The Papers of George Mason, 1725-1792 edited by Robert A. Rutland
[Chapel Hill, 1972

"... The answer is that one would like to be both the one and the other; but
because it is difficult to combine them, it is far better to be feared than
loved if you cannot be both. ...Men worry less about doing an injury to one
who makes himself loved than to one who makes himself feared.  The bond of
love is one which men, wretched creatures that they are, break when it is to
their advantage to do so; but fear is strengthened by a dread of punishment
which is always effective." -- Machivelli - The Prince; Chapter 17

In the arguments over the validity of the Theory of Quantum Mechanics, Dr.

"Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long
and hard the road may be; for without victory there is no survival." --

a few points and repeat them over and over." - Joseph Goebbels - Nazi

We, free citizens of the Great Republic, feel an honest pride in her
greatness, her strength, her just and gentle government, her wide liberties,
her honored name, her stainless history, her unbesmirched flag, her hands
clean from oppression of the weak and from malicious conquest, her hospitable
door that stands open to the hunted and the persecuted of all nations; we are
proud of the judicious respect in which she is held by monarchies which hem
her in on every side, and proudest of all of that loft patriotism which we
inherited from our fathers, which we have kept pure, and which won our
liberties in the beginning and has preserved them unto this day. While
patriotism endures the Republic is safe, her greatness is secure, and against
them the powers of the earth can not prevail." -- Mark Twain

Kill everyone and you are a God. -- Jean Rostand

"...The right of the people peacefully to assemble for lawful purposes
existed long before the adoption of the Constitution of the United States.
In fact, it is and always has been one of the attributes of a free
government.  It `derives its source,' to use the language of Chief Justice
Marshall, in Gibbons v Ogden, 9 Wheat., 211, `from those laws whose authority
is acknowledged by civilized man throughout the world.'  It is found wherever
civilization exists.  It was not, therefore, a right granted to the people by
the Constitution... The second and tenth counts are equally defective.  The
right there specified is that of `bearing arms for a lawful purpose.'  This
is not a right granted by the constitution.  Neither is it in any manner
dependant upon that instrument for its existance.  The Second Amendment
declares that it shall not infringed; but this, as has been seen, means no
more than it shall not be infringed by Congress.  This is one of the
amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the
National Government..." UNITED STATES v. CRUIKSHANK; 92 US 542; (1875)

The end move in politics is always to pick up a gun. --- R. Buckminster Fuller

 (c) JOKEMASTER, 1995


 
 When men get married, they lose much more than women in the same situation.
 Before marriage, most men can dress themselves, more or less, drive a car
 without instructions, eat food without making too much of a mess, and
 generally muddle through life blissfully unaware that everything they are
 doing is wrong. Example:
 Getting ready for a party or family get-together, you (the man) put on clean
 underwear, socks, jeans and a shirt. Checking in the mirror, you note with
 satisfation that all the naughty parts are hidden, and no holes are apparent.
 Smiling smuggly, you exit the bedroom and stand in front of the woman you
 plan to be with all your life. "How do I look, honey?" you ask, knowing
 she'll be overjoyed to see her man decked out in his splendor. Your wife
 barely glances at you and says "You're not wearing THAT, are you?"
 Thinking fast, you reply, "Why, no. Of course not. I just put this on to show
 you what I WOULDN'T wear this evening. What do you think I should wear?" She
 rattles off some discriptive words that sound like English. Words such as
 taupe, flair-front, crew neck, french cuff (which sounds a lot like some
 kinky sex thing, but isn't), single breasted (ditto the last parentheses),
 and cordovans. As she winds down, one thing sticks in your mind, "She said
 the socks and tie should match." Every man knows that if he see another man
 with matching socks and tie, the man is wearing a gift. But you do your best,
 and eventually she allows you to step out in public.
 Next, driving the car.
 

 
 Driving an automobile, as we've all been taught, is a serious endevour.
 That's why I find it hard to believe how many men (and women) take speed
 limits and stoplights as mere suggestions, but enough preaching.
 Men and women drive differently. I know this because my bride didn't have a
 drivers license when we married. Loving husband that I was, I undertook
 teaching her how to operate a motor vehicle. This was one of the biggest
 mistakes of my life (aside from joining the Marine Corps during the Southeast
 Asia War Games, or Viet Nam, in which I'm proud to say, we came in second
 place). After dilligently explaining the rules of the road (she said there
 were too many), demonstrating the various controls on my VW Rabbit, and
 taking her for test drives in empty parking lots, I felt she was ready for
 the right of passage...THE DRIVERS EXAM!!! I waited breathlessly as she and
 the man from the Secretary of State's Office entered my car, and my wife
 drove away. Time passed....a lot of time passed....almost an hour passed, and
 still no little VW appeared on the horizon. Finally a cab pulled up, and out
 stepped my wife and the instructor, who looked very disgruntled (what does
 "gruntled" look like?). He walked up to me, handed me the keys to my car, and
 mumbled something about thanking God for seatbelts.
 My wife was in tears, black lines of mascara ran down her cheeks. I gently
 took her by the shoulders, shook her almost senseless, and with love in my
 voice screamed in her ear, "WHERE THE HELL IS MY CAR?" Between sobs, she
 managed to convey that she had attempted to make a left hand turn from the
 right lane, suprising both the instructor and the car next to mine because
 she had the right turn signal on. By all accounts, the crash was tremendous,
 glass flying in all directions, the sound of crumpling metal, and the mingled
 screams of my wife and the instructor.
 The instructor not only didn't give my wife a license, he suspended mine for
 teaching her.
 


 Cooking is important in a relationship. Who's doing the cooking is almost as
 important. Most men, if a can opener and microwave are handy, can sustain
 themselves between fast food binges, but women are under the impression that
 only a female can really cook (I mentioned this to Wolfgang Puck, and the
 little man laughed and laughed), and banish their husbands from the kitchen
 soon after the honeymoon. This, by the way, is why when men empty the
 dishwasher, they never know where anything belongs. It's not, as some women
 have suggested, a genetic trait, just ignorance borne of bannishment. But
 enough of this, back to the cooking.
 Women are used to the way they cook, men are used to the way their mothers
 cook, and herein begins the problem. Example from my marriage:
 My ex-wife was a religious cook. Every dinner tasted like the Last Supper.
 The first meal she cooked for us after our honeymoon (another disaster best
 left for another day) was placed in front of me by my bride, beaming proudly
 at the mass of meat that could only be identified by dental charts. "I can
 cook pot roast and peach cobbler." she said with pride. Without thinking I
 said, "And which one is this?" That was the first time I had to defend myself
 against a crazed woman armed with a peppermill. The last time, too, now that
 I think about it. There were always one of three results when my wife cooked;
 heartburn or stomach cramps, or both with the added pleasure of liquid
 squirting out of places from which it's not normal. It's hard for me to
 remember my wife's most memorable dish...I had so many of them thrown at me,
 but that's another story, too.
 

 
 Women are empathic, men are pathetic. We haven't got a clue as to empathizing
 with another human being. Male bonding consists of hitting each other on the
 shoulder, swearing a lot, and talking about the latest football game (Go
 Bears!!!) while consuming huge amounts of beer. Female bonding is another
 thing all together. It consists of expressing emotions from despair to bliss,
 talking of inner feelings and personal relationships, and, of course, how
 clueless we men are. Example from my marriage:
 Shorty after our Honeymoon, my bride stepped between me and the television,
 and said "We have to talk." Being new to the married thing, and not knowing
 the ramifications of a "we have to talk" talk, I immediately turned the TV
 off (the Bears were winning big anyway, and I was out of beer), and said
 "Whatever is bothering you is bothering me. Tell me about it." This was, I
 thought, just the kind of careing, loving statement a good husband should
 make under the circumstances. She tured tear-filled eyes toward me and said
 "I feel all empty inside." I said (and here comes the clueless part), "Well,
 why don't you make yourself a sandwich, then? We could order some carry-out."
 When I woke up, my clothes were tossed all over the room, and I was still in
 them. I had a splitting headache, and a vague realization that I had made
 some major mistake. I
 wasn't sure just what it was, but after a few repetitions of, more or less,
 this same scene, it began to dawn on me....at least once each day a woman is
 going to ask her man a question that will determine his sex life for the next
 twenty-four hours. The trick is learning to spot just which question this is.
 It could be something as simple as "Did you like your dinner?" to the always
 confusing, and always fustrating "Do I look fat in this?" There is no right
 answer to this question. Either way, you're screwed...or not screwed to be
 exact. But one question should be banned from the female volcabulary: "Do you
 think she's prettier than me?" She always is, but we have to lie, and lie
 convincingly, to get laid that night.
 

 
 Women hold all the power in any relationship. They know, and we (men) know
 it. They know that we know it, and they know that we know that they know
 it....I could go on, but what's the point? The point is, as some feminist
 once said "Any woman who wants to be equal with a man is setting her sights
 too low." Granted, things have changed since Janis Ian sang "....then married
 and retire.", but not much. While the average wife in today's world does work
 (and granted, she usually makes less money than her male counterpart), there
 is a fair number of women who, when they slipped the ring on their grooms
 finger, it was the last thing they did by hand. Coming home from work one
 day, I found my bride laying on the couch, a wet cloth over her eyes. I
 rushed over, filled with concern and asked "What's the matter, darling?" She
 moved the cloth enough to expose one eye, and whimpered "I did the laundry
 today." Now, I've done my fair share of laundry in my time, and I have never
 found it to be very exhausting. She said, "But I fold the clothes." She can
 bend cotton with her bare hands? Hope I never run into her in a dark alley. "
 And I separate." I've separted, too, on several occasions, most not including
 clothes, but in any event, it was not the most tiring experience of my life.
 Next came vacuuming. I bought a self-propelled, automatic adjusting (what
 ever that means), Tim Allen powered vacuum with a headlight. (What's the
 light for? Does it blind the dust bunnies so they freeze like deer caught in
 the headlights of your car, thus making them easier to catch?) I've used it.
 It takes less energy to sweep the living room with this contraption than it
 does to floss your teeth. Dusting is a big one. "I have to move everything
 out of the way and then put it back.", the "everything"  being the various
 pieces of bric-a-brac we all have scattered around our homes, most times with
 no rhyme or reason. I told her to do what every man in the world does, dust
 around them. It stands to reason that if a small statue has been sitting in
 one spot for the past week, there's no dust under it. But, since this is the
 final installment, let me leave you with these words of wisdom I just made
 up: Every morning when a man wakes up, he should be bigger, weigh more have
 more facial hair, and a deeper voice than the person in bed next to him.
 (A quick note on why I'm terminating this series: Ever since I started
 writing these postings, I have gotten nothing but complimentary mailings from
 all over the world, and I was very, very happy to hear from you all. I tried
 to respond to each in kind, and I believe I did. If I missed anyone, please
 except my deepest regreats. But this morning two things happened; one, I got
 a posting from someone who thinks this whole thing has been a waste of space.
 If anyone else thinks so, again, I'm sorry. Second, a publisher has contacted
 me and wants me to write all of this and more in a book. We're having lunch
 tomorrow, and it sounds pretty good. Again, thank you all for your kind
 words, and I'll still be posting jokes, just not this series.)

 A collection of SPAM Haikus
==========================

Pink tender morsel,
Glistening with salty gel.
What the hell is it?

  --------------

Ears, snouts and inards,
A homogeneous mass.
Pass another slice.

  --------------

Cube of cold pinkness
Yellow specks of porcine fat.
Give me a spork please.

  --------------

Old man seeks doctor.
"I eat SPAM daily", says he.
Angioplasty.

  --------------

Highly unnatural,
The tortured shape of this "food":
A small pink coffin.


I spilled spot remover on my dog.  He's gone now.

I bought some powdered water, but I don't know what to add.

I put instant coffee in a microwave oven and almost went back in time.

It doesn't matter what temperature the room is;
it's always room-temperature.

If you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the precipitate.

It's a small world,
but I wouldn't want to have to paint it.

You can't have everything...where would you put it?

I went to a restaurant that serves "breakfast at any time"
So I ordered French toast during the Renaissance.

I stayed up all night playing poker with tarot cards.
I got a full house and four people died.

Right now I'm having amnesia and deja vu at the same time.
I think I've forgotten this before.

I went to a general store.
They wouldn't let me buy anything specifically.

I went down the street to the 24-hour grocery.
When I got there, the guy was locking the front door.
I said, "Hey, the sign says you're open 24 hours"
He said, "Yes, but not in a row"

I love to go shopping.
I love to freak out salespeople.
They ask me if they can help me, and I say,
"Have you got anything I'd like?"
Then they ask me what size I need, and I say,
"Extra medium"

I bought some batteries, but they weren't included.
So I had to buy them again.

While I was gone,
someone stole everything in my apartment
and replaced it with an exact replica.
When I told my roommate, he said, "Do I know you?"

I installed a skylight in my apartment.
The people who live above me are furious!
In my house there's this light switch that doesn't do anything.
Every so often I would flick it on and off just to check.
Yesterday, I got a call from a woman in Germany.
She said, "Cut it out"

On the ceilings in my house,
I have paintings of the rooms above so I never have to go upstairs.

I used to work in a fire hydrant factory.
You couldn't park anywhere near the place.

I have an answering machine in my car.
It says, "I'm home now.
But leave a message and I'll call when I'm out"

I was going 70 miles an hour and got stopped by a cop who said,
"Do you know the speed limit is 55 miles per hour?"
"Yes, officer, but I wasn't going to be out that long"

One time a cop pulled me over for running a stop sign.
He said, "Didn't you see the stop sign?"
I said, "Yeah, but I don't believe everything I read"

I got my driver's license photo taken out of focus on purpose.
Now when I get pulled over, the cop looks at it
[moving it nearer and farther, trying to see it clearly],
and says, "Here, you can go"

The judge asked, "What do you plead?"
I said, "Insanity, your honor.
Who in their right mind would park in the passing lane?"

When I get real bored,
I like to drive downtown and get a great parking spot,
then sit in my car and count how many people ask me if I'm leaving.

Yesterday I parked my car in a tow-away zone.
When I came back the entire area was missing.

I replaced the headlights in my car with strobe lights.
Now it looks like I'm the only one moving.

For a while I didn't have a car...I had a helicopter...no place to park it, so I
just tied it to a lamp post and left it running.
[slow glance upward]

I was trying to daydream, but my mind kept wandering.

I hate it when my foot falls asleep during the day because that
means it's going to be up all night.
Last night I fell asleep in a satellite dish.
My dreams were broadcast all over the world.

When I woke up this morning my girlfriend asked me,
"Did you sleep well?"
I said, "No, I made a few mistakes"

I got up one morning and couldn't find my socks, so I called
Information.
She said, "Hello, Information"
I said, "I can't find my socks"
She said, "They're behind the couch"

I bought a self learning record to learn Spanish.  I turned it
on and went to sleep; the record got stuck.  The next day I
could only stutter in Spanish.

I was born by Caesarian section...but not so you'd notice.
It's just that when I leave a house, I go out through the
window.

When I was a little kid we had a sand box.
It was a quicksand box.
I was an only child...eventually.

Well, you know when you're rocking in a rocking chair, and you
go so far that you almost fall over backwards, but at the last
instant you catch yourself?  That's how I feel all the time.

I was reading the dictionary.
I thought it was a poem about everything.

What's another word for Thesaurus?

After they make styrofoam, what do they ship it in?

Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time.

I had some eyeglasses.
I was walking down the street when suddenly the prescription ran out.

I saw a subliminal advertising executive, but only for a second.

I have the world's largest collection of seashells.
I keep it on all the beaches of the world...perhaps you've seen it.

I have a map of the United States...actual size.
It says, "Scale: 1 mile = 1 mile"
I spent last summer folding it.
I also have a full-size map of the world.
I hardly ever unroll it.
I busted a mirror and got seven years bad luck,
but my lawyer thinks he can get me five.

Smoking cures weight problems...eventually.

I took a course in speed waiting.
Now I can wait an hour in only ten minutes.

My friend Winnie is a procrastinator.
He didn't get his birth mark til he was eight years old.

If you can't hear me, it's because I'm in parentheses.

My friend asked me how long I was going to be gone on this tour.
I said, "The whole time"

I just bought a microwave fireplace.
You can spend an evening in front of it in only eight minutes.

My friend has a baby.
I'm writing down all the noises he makes
so later I can ask him what he meant.

I like to torture my plants by watering them with ice cubes.

Today I dialed a wrong number.
The other side said, "Hello?" and I said,
"Hello, could I speak to Joey?"
They said, "Uh, I don't think so...He's only two months old"
I said, "I'll wait"

Do you think that when they asked George Washington for ID
that he just whipped out a quarter?

A friend of mine is into Voodoo Acupuncture.
You don't have to go.
You'll just be walking down the street,
and...ooooohhhhhh, that's much better.

I got a new shadow.
I had to get rid of the other one.
It wasn't doing what I was doing.
Well, I've received some more Steve Wright jokes, most from
MaccuPicchu <star1357@ix.netcom.com> and a few others from a guy where
I work.  So here are some, and I'll send the rest tomorrow. :-)

I was arrested today for scalping low numbers at the deli...sold #3 for
$28 bucks.

I bought some batteries, but they weren't included...so I had to buy
them again. What do batteries run on? Why is the alphabet in that
order? Is it because of that song...guy who wrote that wrote
everything.

I went to a museum where they had all the heads and arms from all the
statues in all the other museums.

Why is it a penny for your thoughts, but you have to put your two-cents
in.

Every once in a while I like to stick my head out the window, look up
at the sky and smile...for a satellite picture.

I used to be a proofreader for a skywriting company.

Once I worked for a natural organic health food store in Seattle,
Washington...one day a man walked in and said "If I melt dry ice can I
swim without getting wet."  I said, "I don't know...let me ask Tony."

I told her I knew when I was going to die because my birth certificate
had an expiration date on it.

I bought a ticket on Airline Bizarre...a one-way round-trip ticket...
You leave any Monday and they bring you back the previous Friday...
that way you still have the weekend.

I got an answering machine for my phone...now, when I'm not home and
somebody calls me up...they hear a recording of a busy signal.

Sorry...my mind was wandering...one time it went all the way to Venus
and ordered a meal I couldn't pay for.

I walked up to a beautiful woman in a bar and I said "Do you live
around here often?" And she said, "You're wearing two different colored
socks"...and I said, "I know, but to me they're the same, I go by
thickness."

I have the oldest typewriter in the world...it types in pencil.

I was walking my dog around my building on the ledge...a lot of people
are afraid of heights...not me, I'm afraid of widths.

My dog is an East German Shepherd.

My girlfriend has a Queen-size bed...I have a CourtJester size bed...
it's red and green, has bells on it...and the ends curl up.
Do you remember the one in which he says he took his dog for a walk...
all the way from New York to Florida...
then he said to his dog "There now you're done."

Or how about the one in which he says he named his dog "Stay"...
so he could say "Come here, Stay.  Come here, Stay."

I went to a restaurant. It said "Breakfast anytime"...so I ordered
French Toast during the Renaissance.

One time right in the middle of a job interview, I took out a book and
started reading...The guy said "What the hell are you doing? I said
"Let me ask you a question...If you were in a vehicle and you were
travelling at the speed of light, and then you turned your headlights
on...would they do anything?"  He said, "I don't know." I said "Forget
it then, I don't want to work for you."

I've never seen electricity, that's why I don't pay for it.

I'm writing a book. I have the page numbers down...I just have to fill
in the rest.

I have a microwave fireplace. You can lay down in front of the fire for
the entire evening in 8 minutes.

Coming back from Canada...as I crossed over the border...I was asked if
had any firearms...I said, "What do you need?"

My watch is three hours fast and I can't fix it, so I'm going to move
to New York.

I was on a ski lift with another person...no one I knew...and he didn't
say a word until we were half way up the mountain...then he said, "I
haven't been skiing in ten years."
I said "How come?"
He said "I was in jail."
I didn't say anything.
He said, "You wanna know why?"
I said, "Not really."
He said, "I'll tell you anyway...
I was jailed for pushing a complete stranger off a ferris wheel."

I put tape on my mirrors at my house so I won't accidentally walk
through them into another dimension.

I went to the fights, and a hockey game broke out.

I put a new engine in my car, but I forgot to take the old
one out now I can go 300 mp/h.

The power in my apartment went out the other night.  I had to
use the flash on my camera to find my way around.  I took
twenty seven pictures of my kitchen while I was making a sandwich.

    In every hierarchy, whether it be government or business, each

    Each of us is a mixture of good qualities and some (perhaps)
    not-so-good qualities.  In considering our fellow people we
    should remember their good qualities and realize that their

    and T is the number of hours in a work period.
 Professor Gordon's Rule of Evolving Bryographic Systems
    While bryographic plants are typically encountered in
    substrata of earthy or mineral matter in concreted state,
    discrete substrata elements occasionally display a roughly
    spherical configuration which, in presence of suitable
    gravitational and other effects, lends itself to combined
    translatory and rotational motion.  One notices in such cases
    an absence of the otherwise typical accretion of bryophyta.
    We therefore conclude that a rolling stone gathers no moss.
