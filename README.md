# jokes
jokes dataset for LSTM

I'm learning about AI with the goal of contributing to OpenAI. 
I created the data set in here by doing a web search for text files contining jokes. I take no responsibility for the 
content of these files. I didn't write any of it, and I've only skimmed it. If there's anything horrible in here, or that 
doesn't belong, let me know or create a pull request.

I downloaded the docker image for using torch-rnn from @crisbal (https://github.com/crisbal/docker-torch-rnn) 
and am working with it to try to train a model and generate funny text, as requested here:
