# jokes
jokes dataset for LSTM

I'm learning about AI with the goal of contributing to OpenAI. 
I created the data set in here by doing a web search for text files contining jokes.
I downloaded the docker image for using torch-rnn from @crisbal (https://github.com/crisbal/docker-torch-rnn) 
and am working with it to try to train a model and generate funny text, as requested here:
